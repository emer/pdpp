# DARWIN - c++ (g++) 3.1 (os X 10.2)
####################################################

# this is for Mac OSX, aka darwin.  it is pretty standard (linux-like), except
# you need to do the following steps:

# all actions below need to be as root (sudo su in osx):

# 0. you need the developer's tools, to get the g++ compiler and all the
# system headers, etc.  find this on the apple website.

# 1. fake malloc.h
# touch /usr/include/malloc.h

# 2. readline is not included, so:
# get readline-4.3.tar.gz from ftp://ftp.gnu.org
# (or our ftp site in darwin)
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local; make; make install 
# (puts libreadline.a in /usr/local/lib -- the .dylib seems to fail but its ok)

# 3. libjpeg is not included, so: 
# grab the libjpeg code from the home website:
# www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
# (or get it from our ftp server in darwin)
# ./configure; make; make install-lib

# if you want to compile interviews:
# 1. requires iv-15.tar.gz
# 2. ./configure --prefix=/usr/local; make; make install

# That should be it!
