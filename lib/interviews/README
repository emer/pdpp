Interviews for PDP++ has improved significantly for the 2.0 release.

See ANNOUNCE.IV_PATCHES for details.

Makefile.IV_CYGWIN is the makefile for src/lib/IV/CYGWIN for compiling
under CYGWIN (which happens the old way still).  It should be found in
this directory when the iv-pdp-r2.0.tar.gz file is installed.
