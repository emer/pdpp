	xor.proj.gz			This is the XOR example used in the
					tutorial in the manual.

	xor.handbook.proj.gz		This is a version of the XOR example
					that more closely replicates the version
					in the 1987 PDP "explorations" handbook.

	424.*				These are completed examples of the 424
					encoder problem from the 2nd part of the
					tutorial.  Use them to compare to your own!

	gridsearch_xor.proj.gz		This is a project that uses the GridSearch
					batch process, and also saves networks
					automatically.

	load,save_opdp_wts.css		These are script code examples that
					load and save weights from xor in the
					form used by the old pdp software

	xor.wts				These are the default weights from the
					old pdp version of xor.  load them in
					with load_opdp_wts.css

	xor.init.net.gz			This is a network saved with the xor.wts
					already loaded in.

	xor_set_params.css		This is script code used in the xor
					project to give easy access to parameters
					and it performs some basic functions.
					It shows how to do graphical editing of
					CSS class objects.

	xor.pat, xor.orig.pat		These are "pattern" files, which contain
					the XOR environment in old PDP format.
					They can be read in using 'ReadOldPDP' in
					the Environment.

	xor.env.gz			This is the XOR environment saved in the
					PDP++ native format.
