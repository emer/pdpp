nav.proj.gz:	Demonstrates an interactive script environment where events
		are created on each trial in response to the network output.
		In this case, input is current location in a 10x10 grid, and
		output is which of 4 directions to move next.  The training
		is simplistic: a training signal is provided to get the network
		to go to the goal location (position 5x5) most directly.  
		Reinforcement learning algorithms can actually discover the 
		route to the goal, but this is just to test the technology.
