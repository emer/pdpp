pdp++/demo/bench

This directory contains a variety of benchmarking code:

aptest:	       Array vs. pointer test -- runs basic netin (dot product)
	       computation loops in either array or pointer format.
	       This is the simplest, most basic benchmark.

pdp++bench:    Uses core code extracted from pdp++ to implement backprop
	       for benchmarking.  Provides a very realistic benchmark
	       for actual pdp++ performance, while also being much easier
	       to run on a novel platform than compiling all of pdp++!
	       This is the main benchmark to use.

actual_pdp++:  Uses actual pdp++ projects to run simple benchmarks,
	       also has comparison projects for old pdp software.

d_pdp++_bench: A version of pdp++bench for distributed memory (MPI)
	       benchmarking.  This version may not accurately reflect 
	       actual implementation in pdp++ -- was for early testing.

dmem_bench:    Distributed memory benchmarks (MPI) using actual pdp++
	       projects.  This is the main distributed memory benchmark
	       directory.

petsc_bench:   A simple test of the petsc parallel computing package
	       (runs on top of MPI) -- was not used in pdp++.

pthread_bench: Parallel threads benchmarks -- this was the form of
	       parallel processing supported prior to dmem/MPI, but is
	       no longer supported in the 3.0 release.  Results were
	       rarely better than .75 speedup on 2 procs, compared to
	       a .5 or better(!) speedup with dmem for large nets.
