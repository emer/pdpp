PDPDIR/src/hard_of_css

This directory provides a demo for compiling a standalone css script
into an executable program using c++.

See Makefile.in (same as PDPDIR/config/Makefile.hard_of_css) for more
detailed instructions.

hofcss_demo.css is a demo very simple and useless script that can be compiled.

the .cc version is just a link because g++ won't compile files ending in .css
