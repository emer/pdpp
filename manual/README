This directory contains the manual for pdp++ and TA/CSS

The pdp-user files are the PDP++ user's manual.  A manual focusing 
more on the programming aspect of PDP++ (pdp-prog) may someday be
written.

The ta_css files are mostly just a subset of the PDP++ user's manual,
selected for those parts of relevance to the underlying TA/CSS
technology.

The pdp-user[-#] and ta_css[-#] files are in "info" format for
use in emacs or with the xinfo program.

The pdp-user.ps.gz and ta_css.ps.gz files are in PostScript format for
printing or viewing with a previewer.

The html directory contains html format files.

The *.texi files are the "source" files for the manual, in texinfo
format.

The Makefile has actions for creating various format files from the
texinfo sources.
