<H1><A NAME="IDX885" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">12  Processes and Statistics</A></H1>

<P>
Processes in PDP++ play the role of orchestrating and coordinating the
interactions between different object types in order to carry out
particular tasks.  Processes are <I>objects</I> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_88.html">8.1.1  What is an Object?</A>),
which means that they can have their own variables and functions. This
is fundamentally different from the idea of a process as something that
simply acts on a data structure.  There are many different kinds of
process objects which have been designed to perform specific kinds of
tasks.

</P>
<P>
The scheduling processes coordinate the overall scheduling of processing
during training and testing of networks, and are the "backbone" of
processing system.  They are organized into a hierarchy of objects, each
of which performs a specific level of processing:
<PRE>TrainProcess (loop over epochs)
    EpochProcess (loop over trials)
        TrialProcess (present a single pattern)
        .
        .
    .
    .
</PRE>

<P>
The rest of the processes hang off of the schedule processes in
different places, and perform specific tasks.  The largest category of
such processes are <EM>statistics</EM>, which compute and record data
about the network, environment or other processes, and make this data
available to the logs for displaying.

</P>
<P>
Statistics often need to be viewed at multiple levels of processing.
Thus, one often wants to simultaneously view the trial-wise and the
aggregated epoch-summed squared error.  This is accomplished in PDP++ by
having statistics which actually compute the squared-error for a given
event in the trial process, but also copies of this squared-error
statistic at subsequent (higher) levels of processing which perform the
<EM>aggregation</EM> of the statistic over these higher levels.

</P>
<P>
Since the different time-grains of processing are represented by the
schedule process hierarchy, other things like updating displays and
logging data, which can also happen at different time-grains, are tied
to the schedule process hierarchy.  Thus, one can decide to log data at
the <B>TrialProcess</B>, <B>EpochProcess</B>, and/or <B>TrainProcess</B> level,
and similarly for updating displays like the network viewer.

</P>
<P>
The code to control a Process can either be hard-coded C++
code, or a pointer to a CSS script file. This means that one can change
the behavior of a Process simply a writing a CSS script and setting the
Process to use it (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_180.html">12.9  Processes and CSS Scripts</A>).

</P>
<P>
The best way to interact and configure processes is throught the project
viewer (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_104.html">9.2  The Project Viewer</A>).  Processes edit dialogs are yellow
(<CODE>SchedProcess</CODE>) gold (regular <CODE>Process</CODE>) or slate blue
(<CODE>Stat</CODE>) in the default color scheme.

</P>
<P>
The <B>EpochProcess</B> can also coordinate the processing of different
events on different <EM>distributed memory processors</EM> to achieve
much faster processing on parallel hardware (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_157.html">12.5.0.1  Distributed Memory Computation in the EpochProcess</A>).
