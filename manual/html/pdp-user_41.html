<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>How to I set a stopping criterion for training?</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
 
The stopping criterion is part of the statistic process that has the
data on which the criterion is based.  Thus, if you want to stop
training based on sum-squared-error, the <B>SE_Stat</B>
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_172.html">12.8.1  Summed-Error Statistics</A>) is where to go to set the criterion.  The
criterion is always set in the statistic that is located in the
<CODE>loop_stats</CODE> of the process you wish to stop.  So, if you wan to
stop training, look in the <B>TrainProcess</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_155.html">12.4.2  Iterating over Epochs: TrainProcess</A>)
for the statistic.

<DT><B>How do I record the activations of the units in my network?</B>
<DD>
This is accomplished by creating a <B>MonitorStat</B>, which gathers
information from the network and makes it available for logging.  The
easiest way to do this is through the <B>NetView</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_129.html">10.6  Network Viewer</A>),
where you can select the objects to be monitored, the variable to
monitor, and it will create an appropriate MonitorStat for you.  Or,
you can use <CODE>Stats/RecordLayerValues</CODE> from the <B>Wizard</B>
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_45.html">5.5  The Wizard Object</A>). Note that the monitor stat is created in the
schedule process that corresponds to the time-grain at which you want
the information recorded.  It is the log of this process which will
show the values you are recording.  For more info, see
section <A HREF="pdp-user_173.html">12.8.2  Monitoring Network State Variables</A>.

<DT><B>How do I analyze the representations in my network (e.g., cluster plots, PCA, MDS)?</B>
<DD>
There are two basic strategies.  Both start by recording data from the
appropriate layer in the network (e.g., the hidden layer), using a
<B>MonitorStat</B> as described above.  The simplest, but less automated,
technique is just create a log of the recorded data (e.g., if
recording at the Trial process level, create a log of the trial
process -- any kind of log will do, but a <B>GridLog</B> might be the
most appropriate), and then use the <CODE>Analyze</CODE> menu on the log to
analyze the data (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_185.html">13.3.1  The LogView Class</A>).  When using this
technique, you need to remember to clear the log at the appropriate
time so it contains just the data you want to analyze.

A more automated technique involves copying the monitored information
into an environment using a <B>CopyToEnvStat</B> -- the environment
serves as a kind of data buffer for the network activations, and
contains the necessary analysis routines.  Once the data is copied
into the environment, you can just use the <CODE>Analyze</CODE> menu, or
better yet, create a <B>DispDataEnvProc</B> that automatically displays
the results of an analysis of a data environment.  This latter
technique is employed by the <B>Wizard</B> <CODE>Stats/Analyze Net Layer</CODE>
function, which automates all of the above steps, and is highly
recommended.  Pieces of these steps are also found in related wizard
functions such as <CODE>Auto Analyze Data Env</CODE> and <CODE>Save Values
in Data Env</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_45.html">5.5  The Wizard Object</A>.

Regardless of the technique, the set of available analyses, which
include cluster plots, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) are described in the <B>Environment</B>
<CODE>Analyze</CODE> menu (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_145.html">11.9  Environment Analysis Functions</A>).

<DT><B>How can I get receptive field plots from my network?</B>
<DD>
The <B>UnitActRFStat</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_176.html">12.8.5  Activity-based Receptive Fields</A>) and
<B>DispNetWeightsProc</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_166.html">12.6.5  Miscellaneous other Process Types</A>) processes both
support the display of receptive fields.  The former uses a
reverse-correlation technique that works for any set of layers,
regardless of connectivity, while the latter only plots directly
connected sets of weights.  These are supported by the <B>Wizard</B>
<CODE>Act Based Receptive Field</CODE> and <CODE>Display Net Weights</CODE>
functions (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_45.html">5.5  The Wizard Object</A>).

<DT><B>How do I record a reaction time measure (cycles) from my network?</B>
<DD>
Experience in a variety of cases has shown that human reaction times
can be best modeled by recording the number of processing cycles it
takes for a response/output layer unit to exceed some kind of activity
threshold.  This can be measured with the <B>ActThreshRTStat</B>
section <A HREF="pdp-user_177.html">12.8.6  Reaction-time Based on Crossing an Activation Threshold</A> (see also the <B>Wizard</B> <CODE>Stop On Act Thresh</CODE>
function, section <A HREF="pdp-user_45.html">5.5  The Wizard Object</A>).  One can also use the <B>CyclesToSettle</B>
statistic (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_179.html">12.8.8  Miscellaneous Other Stat Types</A>) to record however many cycles were
used during a <B>Settle</B> process, but be careful because the settle
process is typically stopped by a statistic that records the change in
activation over time (in <TT>`cs++'</TT> this is <B>CsMaxDa</B>; in
<TT>`leabra++'</TT> it is <B>LeabraMaxDa</B>), to ensure that the activation
changes have gone below some threshold.  This kind of change-based
reaction time measure is typically not such a good measure of human
reaction time.

<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<DT><B>How do I run my network in the background for training?</B>
<DD>
Often networks take a while to learn, and it is nice to be able to run
them in the background for a day or two. To do this, get the network all
setup to train, save it, and then use the following type of command:
<PRE>unix &#62; pdp++ -nogui -f startup.css &#60;myproj&#62; &#60;extra args&#62; &#38;
</PRE>

where <TT>`pdp++'</TT> refers to the PDP++ executable you are using (bp++,
cs++, etc), and <CODE>-nogui</CODE> tells it to not open up the graphical user
interface, and <CODE>-f startup.css</CODE> is a script file that will automate
the process of loading the project and running it.  For more information
on different startup arguments for PDP++, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_105.html">9.3  Startup Arguments to PDP++</A>.  Also,
check out the comments at the top of <TT>`startup.css'</TT> (located in the
<TT>`css/include'</TT> directory) to see what kinds of assumptions it makes
about your project.  Also see section <A HREF="pdp-user_110.html">9.6  Project Scripts</A> for more useful scripts
that you can use.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_106.html">9.4  Signals to Control a PDP++ Process</A> for information on how to
control the process once it is running in the background.

<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<DT><B>How do I automatically save my networks after training?</B>
<DD>
This can be accomplished by creating a <B>SaveNetsProc</B> or
<B>SaveWtsProc</B> in the <CODE>final_procs</CODE> group of an appropriate Batch
or Train process.  This process names the network with the name field
of the network object plus the current epoch and, if present, batch
counters.  You can set the mod value of this process to save the
networks at different intervals.  An example project using this is
<TT>`demo/bp/gridsearch_xor.proj.gz'</TT>.

There is a CSS script version of this process called
<TT>`save_networks.css'</TT> in the <TT>`css/include'</TT> directory, as well as
a modified version that saves networks that get below some criterion
(which is presumably higher than the stopping criterion), called
<TT>`save_good_nets.css'</TT>.  These scripts are meant to be attached to
<B>ScriptProcess</B> objects created in the <CODE>loop_procs</CODE> group of an
appropriate Batch or Train process.  They basically just issue a save
command on the network, but they also give the network a name based on
the current epoch and/or batch counters.  See these scripts for more
detailed documentation.

<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<DT><B>How do I change one of the processes in my schedule process hierarchy?</B>
<DD>
All objects can be changed to a different type using the Change Type menu
option (ChangeMyType function in CSS).  In the project view, just select
the object you want to change, and hit the Change Type button, and it
will change the type, and reset all the relevant pointers so your
process hierarchy should remain intact.

<DT><B>How do I remove a higher-level process object without losing the lower-level ones?</B>
<DD>
If you remove a process object by using the <I>.processes/</I> <I>Remove</I>
option, it will automatically remove all the processes below the one
removed.  However, if you do <I>Object/Close</I> on the object itself, it
will just remove itself and close-up the gap between the remaining
processes (in terms of stat aggregation, etc).  The <I>Rmv Obj(s)</I>
button on the project view also does this kind of remove.  Finally, you
can use the <I>Structure/RemoveSuperProc</I> and <I>RemoveSubProc</I> menu
options on a process object itself to remove its parent or sub process.

<DT><B>Why can't I change the environment or network pointer in my process?</B>
<DD>
The <CODE>environment</CODE> and <CODE>network</CODE> pointers are automatically
inherited from the parent process in the hierarchy (this is true for
stats and other process objects hanging off of a given process as well).
This means that you can only change these at the top-level process in a
given hierarchy.  On the other hand, it means that when you want to
change these pointers, you only have to change them in one place and
they are automatically propagated to all processes (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_149.html">12.1  The Basic Features of all Processes</A>).

<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<DT><B>Where do I create a given statistic process?</B>
<DD>
Each statistic process "knows" where to create itself in the standard
schedule process hierarchy.  This default location will be the one shown
when you use the <I>NewStat</I> menu option in the <I>.processes</I> menu on
the project.  Use this to create your statistic.  In general, most
statistics should be created in a relatively low-level process, such as
the <B>TrialProcess</B>, since most stats deal with data that changes
event-by-event.  Remember that you create the stat at the lowest level
so that it can compute the raw information, and these low-level values
can be aggregated up the processing hierarchy if higher-level
information is desired, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_171.html">12.8  Different Types of Statistics</A>.

<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<DT><B>Why can't I change the name of my statistic?</B>
<DD>
First, the name of the statistic object is not the same as the label
that is associated with that object in the log (though they are
related), so changing one will not change the other.  The Stat object
names are automatically set to reflect the aggregation and layer
settings of the stat, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_171.html">12.8  Different Types of Statistics</A>.  This is true as long as the
name contains the type name of the stat (e.g., SE_Stat), so if you want
to give a stat a custom name, make sure it doesn't include the type
name.

To change the label associated with the stat as it <EM>appears in the
log</EM>, you need to edit the <B>StatVal</B> object(s) that contains the value of
the statistic.  This object contains a <CODE>name</CODE> field, which is what
determines the label used by the log.  However, as it appears on most
stats (e.g., SE_Stat), the <CODE>name</CODE> field is hidden, so you have to
use the CSS script to set it.  Typing:

<PRE>css&#62; .processes[1].loop_stats[0].se.Edit();
</PRE>

will pull up an editor for the epoch level SE_Stat StatVal (which is the
member <CODE>se</CODE> of an SE_Stat) in the <TT>`demo/bp/xor.proj.gz'</TT> demo,
and allow you to edit the name.  Alternatively you can use
<I>PDP++Root/Object/Browe</I> and click your way through the process
hierarchy until you get to the variable you want to change, and then hit
<I>Select</I> to edit it.  You will have to do a <CODE>GetHeaders</CODE> on the
log to see this new name.  Other stats like ScriptStat have a list of
StatVals, which, when edited, allow you to edit the names directly.

An easier alternative is to simply change the <CODE>display_name</CODE> of the
<B>ViewSpec</B> in the relevant log.

<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<DT><B>How do I get the epoch counter into my testing process?</B>
<DD>
The epoch counter, which is on the <B>TrainProcess</B> is not directly
available to a testing process, which typically is created at the epoch
level.  Thus, you need to add a <B>EpochCounterStat</B> to the final stats
of the process where you want to see the epoch counter.  This gets the
counter off of the network itself.  To get other counters from the
training process hierarchy (i.e., the batch counter), use the
<B>ProcCounterStat</B>.  For more info, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_179.html">12.8.8  Miscellaneous Other Stat Types</A>.

<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<DT><B>How do I determine which event is closest to the output my network actually produced?</B>
<DD>
The <B>ClosestEventStat</B> does exactly this, see
section <A HREF="pdp-user_174.html">12.8.3  Finding The Event Closest to the Current Output Pattern</A>. 

<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<DT><B>How do I create a cross-validation setup?</B>
<DD>
Cross-validation is accomplished by periodically testing during
training.  Thus, you simply need to create a testing process
hierarchy, (at the Epoch level), and link your testing epoch process
into the <CODE>loop_procs</CODE> of the training process.  This can be done
with the <B>Wizard</B> <CODE>Processes/Cross Validation</CODE> function
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_45.html">5.5  The Wizard Object</A>).  You should set the modulo factor (in the
<CODE>mod</CODE> field of the process) of your testing epoch process to
reflect the frequency with which you want to perform testing.  See
<TT>`demo/bp_misc/bp_xval.proj.gz'</TT> for a demonstration of a
cross-validation training setup.

<DT><B>How do I set the stopping criteria for training based on testing error (e.g., for cross-validation)?</B>
<DD>
Add an aggregator stat of the testing epoch stat in the
<CODE>final_stats</CODE> of your training epoch process (i.e., make an
<B>SE_Stat</B> there, set its <CODE>time_agg.from</CODE> to point to your test
epoch <B>SE_Stat</B>, use the <CODE>LAST</CODE> operator).  You will want to
create aggregates of this stat (which is itself an aggregator) using
<CODE>LAST</CODE>, and set the stopping criterion in the aggregator of this
stat in the loop_stats of the train process.  This is all accomplished
by the <B>Wizard</B> <CODE>Processes/Cross Validation</CODE> function.  The
project <TT>`demo/bp_misc/bp_dig_xval.proj.gz'</TT> contains an example of
this.

<DT><B>How do I graph both training and testing error (e.g., for cross-validation)?</B>
<DD>
If you follow the steps for the previous item, a graph log at the level
of the training epoch process will show both the training and testing
error.  Again, see the demo project.

<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<DT><B>How do I make a hybrid network of two different types of</B>
<DD>
algorithms?  Since all schedule process types assume that a given
network has all of the appropriate types of objects (i.e., <B>BpUnit</B>'s,
<B>BpCon</B>'s, etc for backprop), you have to create two separate
networks, and then link them together with a <B>BridgeProcess</B>, see
section <A HREF="pdp-user_165.html">12.6.4  Linking Networks Together with a Bridge</A>.

<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<DT><B>How do I setup distributed memory processing across events?</B>
<DD>
The EpochProcess supports distributed memory processing of events
(using the MPI protocol), where each processor operates on a different
set of events, sharing its results with the other processors to
achieve processing of the entire epoch.  This implies batch-mode
weight updates.  This is very efficient, and can produce nearly-linear
speedups in the number of additional processors used.  See
section <A HREF="pdp-user_157.html">12.5.0.1  Distributed Memory Computation in the EpochProcess</A> for details.
