<H2><A NAME="IDX1334" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">15.1  Overview of the Cs Implementation</A></H2>

<P>
The Cs implementation defines a type of connection and connection spec
that is used by all flavors of Cs networks.  There is a basic CsUnit
which is also common to all algorithms, but each different type of
activation function defines its own version of the basic CsUnitSpec.
Thus, to switch activation functions, one needs only to point one's
units at a new unit spec type.

</P>
<P>
The new schedule process objects consist of three essential levels of
processing, starting at the trial level and moving down through settling
to the cycle, which implements one activation update of the network.
Thus, the <B>CsTrial</B> process loops over the plus and minus phases of
settling in the <B>CsSettle</B> process, which in turn iterates over cycles
of the <B>CsCycle</B> process, which updates the activations of the units
in the network.  There is an optional level of processing which involves
sampling over repeated settlings of the same pattern.  This repeated
sampling is used for learning to obtain reliable statistical estimates
of the probabilities of certain activation states, and is thus used when
learning to match a propability distribution over the output layer
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_227.html">15.7  The Probability Environment and Cs</A>).  This <B>CsSample</B> process loops over samples
of the <B>CsTrial</B> process.

</P>
<P>
There are several specialized statistic objects that compute the global
goodness or energy function of the network (<B>CsGoodStat</B>), and record
its probability of being in one of a number of desired activation states
(<B>CsDistStat</B>), and the extent to which the probabilities of these
states match their desired probabilities (<B>CsTIGstat</B>,
<B>CsTargStat</B>).
