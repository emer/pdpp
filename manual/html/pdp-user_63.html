<H2><A NAME="IDX190" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">6.20  Object Chooser</A></H2>

<P>
The Object Chooser Dialog is much like the file requester described
previously, and is used primarily for choosing objects when there are
too many such objects to fit within a menu.  It can also be used to
browse the entire hierarchy of objects.  In the simple choosing
function, just scroll and pick the object -- double clicking to select,
or using the Select button at the bottom.  A name can also be typed into
the field at the top of the browser.

</P>
<P>
By selecting <I>PDP++Root/Browse</I>, the object chooser acts more like a
file browser.  When you select an object, the default is to descend into
the sub-objects on that object.  Pressing .. will go back up a level (as
in the file system).  When you select an object, an edit dialog will
show up for that object.  This can be used for editing things that may
not show up in a useful way in standard edit dialogs (e.g., the
StatVal's in Stats, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_167.html">12.7  The Statistic Process</A>).
