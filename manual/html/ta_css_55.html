<P>
At the bottom of the Edit Dialog is a row of buttons which have actions
pertaining to the Edit Dialog's fields. Some of the buttons may be
appropriately inactive due the state of the edit dialog. They will
become active when their action is applicable. The following buttons
will be available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Ok</CODE>
<DD>
The Ok button stores the information in the dialog's fields in the
object's fields and closes the dialog window.
<DT><CODE>Apply</CODE>
<DD>
The Apply button stores the information in the dialogs fields but does
not close the window. If the apply button is highlighted the edit dialog
may contain changes which have not been applied yet. The apply action
can also be generated by pressing the Return key in the body of the
editor, unless the editor has multiple field editors within it
(see section <A HREF="ta_css_54.html">7.6.1  Member Fields</A>).
<DT><CODE>Revert</CODE>
<DD>
The Revert button reloads the information from the object into the
dialog's fields, clearing any changes the user might have made. If the
revert button is highlighted the object's fields might have been changed
"behind the scenes" by another part of the program in which case the information
displayed in the edit dialog may be outdated. The revert action can also
be generated by pressing the Escape key in the body of the editor.
<DT><CODE>Cancel</CODE>
<DD>
The Cancel button dismisses the dialog without applying the user's changes.
<DT><CODE>Other Member Buttons</CODE>
<DD>
Some objects will add an additional row of member buttons to the Edit
Dialog.(e.g., The Process object adds a row of Run,Step,Init buttons).
These buttons perform additional actions on the object.
