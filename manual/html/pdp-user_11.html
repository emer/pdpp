Another major distinction that is made in the software reflects the
separation of <EM>state</EM> variables (e.g., the current activation of a
unit) from <EM>specification</EM> variables (e.g., the activation function
to be used in computing activation states, and its associated
parameters).  This distinction is made because it is often desirable to
have many objects use the same specifications, while each retain a
distinct set of state variables.  For example, all of the units in one
layer might use a particular learning rate, while units in another layer
have a different one.  By separating these specifications from the state
variables, it is easy to accomplish this.

<P>
Thus, associated with many different kinds of objects is a corresponding
<CODE>Spec</CODE> object (e.g., a <CODE>UnitSpec</CODE> for <CODE>Unit</CODE> objects,
etc).  While this separation does sometimes make it a little more
difficult to find the parameters which are controlling a given object's
behavior, it makes the software much more flexible.  Furthermore, we
have put most of the specification objects (specs) in one place, so it
should soon become second nature to look in this place to set or change
parameters.  For more information about specs, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_100.html">8.4  Specifications</A>.

</P>
<P>
Specs are also used to control the layout of events and patterns in the
environment (throught the use of <CODE>EventSpec</CODE> and <CODE>PatternSpec</CODE>
objects).  Thus, one first configures these specs, and then creates
events according to them.  A new interface makes configuring these specs
much easier than before.
