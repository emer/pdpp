Since the difference between recurrent backprop and standard
feed-forward backprop is largely a matter of the process-level
orchestration of the different phases, the connection specifications are
identical between the two, with one small difference.  Please refer to
section <A HREF="pdp-user_200.html">14.1.2  Bp Connection Specifications</A> for a description of the relevant parameters.

The exception is only at the level of the equations used to compute the
error derivative terms, which are modified to use the previous
activation value of the sending unit, instead of the current activation,
since the idea is to reduce the error that results at time t as a
function of the activation states that lead up to it, those at time t-1.

Since RBp networks are complex dynamical systems, it is often useful to
place restrictions on the kinds of weights that can develop, in order to
encourage certain kinds of solutions to problems.  One rather direct way
of doing this is by simply limiting the weights to not go above or below
certain values, or to restrict them to be symmetrical.  These can be
accomplished by editing the <B>ConSpec</B>.
