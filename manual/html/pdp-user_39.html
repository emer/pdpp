<P>
Finally, you are ready to run your project.

</P>
<P>
Now you can run through a Test -- just hit <I>Run</I> in the Epoch_1
control panel.  You will see the four patterns flicker through the
<B>NetView</B>, and you will see them logged in the <B>GridLogView</B>.  The
outputs all look pretty much the same, at this point.  But now you can
start to train the network.  Click on <I>Step</I> or <I>Run</I> in the Train
control panel, and you are off and running.

</P>
<P>
You can play around with parameters, etc. as described in the previous
tutorial on running XOR.

</P>
<P>
There is one very important aspect of PDP++ which has not yet been
demonstrated in the tutorial, which we can step through at this point.
This is the ability to apply different parameters to different parts of
the network.  For the purposes of demonstration, we will assume that we
want to have one learning rate for the input-to-hidden weights, and
another learning rate for the hidden-to-output weights.  The basic idea
about how to do this is to create two different <B>ConSpec</B> objects, one
of which applies to the input-to-hidden weights, and another of which
applies to the hidden-to-output weights.  An important facility in PDP++
is the ability to create a <EM>child</EM> spec that automatically inherits
a set of parameters from a <EM>parent</EM> spec, and has a set of unique
parameters.  Thus, for the present example, we would want to create a
child ConSpec that inherits everything from the parent except for the
learning rate, which will be unique to it.  Thus, we will have two
conspecs that are identical except for the learning rate.   The
advantage of this setup is that if you should decide to manipulate other
parameters such as momentum, weight decay, etc, the two specs will
automatically get the same values of these changed parameters.

</P>
<P>
To create the new child ConSpec, locate the Project window, and do
<I>.specs</I> / <I>New Child</I> / <I>BpConSpec_0</I> (note that <I>New Child</I> is
at the bottom of the menu).  This will bring up a New object dialog,
specifying that the new BpConSpec will be created as a child of the
existing one.  Select <I>Ok</I> with the right mouse button, so that the
new child will be edited.  Then, click the mouse into the <I>lrate</I>
field, and enter a new learning rate parameter (e.g., .01).  Notice that
the little check-box next to this field was checked when we clicked in
lrate.  This indicates that this is a <EM>unique</EM> parameter, while the
other, non-checked boxes are <EM>inherited</EM> parameters.  To see how
this works, let's edit the parent spec.  At the top of the edit dialog,
select <I>Actions</I> / <I>Find Parent</I>, which will bring up the edit
dialog for the parent con spec.  Notice that the parent does not have
any of the unique check boxes, since it does not inherit from anything
else.  Now, change another parameter, like <I>momentum</I>, in the
parent dialog, and press <I>Apply</I>.  The <I>Revert</I> button on the child
spec is highlighted, so press it.  Notice that the child dialog displays
the new (changed) momentum value, but retains the unique learning rate
parameter entered before.  Elaborate hierarchies of specs can be
created, and the patterns of inheritence and unique parameters provides
a very clear indication what is specialized about specific spec relative
to the others, and what it has in common.

</P>
<P>
Before closing the edit dialogs, it is a good idea to label them with
mnemonic names -- call the parent "input-to-hidden cons" and the child
"hidden-to-output cons", for example.  Then click <I>Ok</I> on both edit
dialogs.

</P>
<P>
Having created the specs with different learning rates, we now need to
specify that one spec applies to one set of connections, and another
applies to the other set.  As it is now, the parent spec applies to all
projections, since it is the default that was created automatically when
the connections were created.  The best way to set specs is using the
NetView, which has a <I>Selections</I> menu that operates on selected items
in the NetView (it is on the view half (right side) of the window, since
it operates on the items selected in a particular view).  Thus, make
sure you are in <I>Select</I> mode, and select the projection arrow that
goes from the hidden to the output layer.  Then, select <I>Selections</I> /
<I>Set Con Spec</I>.  This will bring up a popup dialog, where you should
select <I>BpConSpec</I> / <I>hidden-to-output cons</I>, and click <I>Ok</I>.
This has now set the selected projection to use this con spec instead of
the default.  To verify the status of the network, click in the
backround of the NetView to unselect everything, and then choose
<I>Selections</I> / <I>Show Con Spec</I>.  In the dialog, select
<I>hidden-to-output cons</I>, and click <I>Ok</I>.  The correct projection
arrow will be selected in the NetView, indicating that it is using that
con spec.  You can repeat this to verify that the other projection is
still using "input-to-hidden cons".  Thus, the <I>Selections</I> menu
allows you to both set and verify which objects in the network are using
which specs.  Notice that you can set many other properties using this
menu much in the same way we just did for ConSpecs on projections.

At this point, you might want to look at some of the other demo projects
available.  These are located in the <TT>`demo'</TT> directory where the XOR
example project was.  Check out the <TT>`README'</TT> files for further
information.
