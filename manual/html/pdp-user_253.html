There is a basic class type called <B>taBase</B> that uses the TypeAccess
type information to perform a number of special functions automatically.
This object is aware of its own type information, and can thus save and
load itself, etc.  Special code has been written in both the TypeAccess
system and in CSS that takes advantage of the interface provided by the
<B>taBase</B> type.  Thus, it is recommended that user's derive all of
their types from this base type, and use special macros to provide
derived types with the hooks necessary to get their own type information
and use it effectively.  The type <B>TAPtr</B> is a <CODE>typedef</CODE> for a
pointer to a <B>taBase</B> object.  The definition of a <B>taBase</B> object
and the macros that are used with it are all in <TT>`ta/ta_base.h'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
All <B>taBase</B> objects have only one member, which is a reference
counter.  This provides a mechanism for determining when it is safe to
delete an object when the object is being referenced or pointed to in
various different places.  <B>taBase</B> provides a set of referencing and
pointer-management functions that simplify the use of a reference-count
based memory management system.  <CODE>Ref</CODE> increments the reference
count, <CODE>unRef</CODE> decrements it, <CODE>Done</CODE> checks if the refcount is
zero, and deletes the object if it is, and <CODE>unRefDone</CODE> does both.
<CODE>Own</CODE> both Ref's an object and sets its owner.  For pointers,
<CODE>SetPointer</CODE> unrefs any existing object that the pointer points to,
and sets it to point to the new object.  <CODE>DelPointer</CODE> does an
<CODE>unRefDone</CODE> on the object pointed to, and sets the pointer to NULL.
<CODE>OwnPointer</CODE> is like SetPointer except it also sets the owner of
the pointed-to object to the one given by the argument.  See
section <A HREF="pdp-user_263.html">18.8.1  Basic Functions</A> and <TT>`ta/ta_base.h'</TT> for more details.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1732"></A>
The one essential function that <B>taBase</B> provides is
<CODE>GetTypeDef()</CODE>, which is a virtual function that returns a pointer
to the <CODE>TypeDef</CODE> type descriptor for this object. This function is
defined as part of the basic macro <CODE>TA_BASEFUNS</CODE>, which must be
included in all classes derived from <B>taBase</B>.  This function makes it
possible for a generic pointer to a taBase object to find out what type
of object is really being pointed to.

</P>
<P>
There are a number of functions defined on the taBase type that simply
call the corresponding function on the <B>TypeDef</B> pointer.  These can
be found in the <TT>`ta/ta_base.h'</TT> header file.  They just make it
easier to call these commonly-used functions, instead of requiring the
user to put in a <CODE>GetTypeDef</CODE> function in between.

</P>
<P>
<B>taBase</B> also provides a simplified way of managing the construction,
deletion, and copying of an object.  Basically, construction is broken
down into a set of functions that <CODE>Initialize</CODE> the member
variables, <CODE>Register</CODE> the new token with the type if it is keeping
track of tokens, and it sets the default name of the object based on its
type name using <CODE>SetDefaultName</CODE>.  The <CODE>TA_BASEFUNS</CODE> macro
defines a default constructor that calls these three functions in that
order.  The user thus needs to provide a <CODE>Initialize</CODE> function for
every class defined, which does the appropriate member initialization.
Note that if this function is not defined, the one on the parent class
will be called twice, so its more efficient to include a blank
Initialize function when there are no members that need to be
initialized.

</P>
<P>
The destructor function is similar to the constructor.  A default
destructor is defined in <CODE>TA_BASEFUNS</CODE>, which simply calls
<CODE>unRegister</CODE>, and <CODE>Destroy</CODE>.  Thus, the user needs to provide
a <CODE>Destroy</CODE> function which frees any additional resources allocated
by the object, etc.  Like <CODE>Initialize</CODE>, a blank <CODE>Destroy</CODE>
should be defined when there is nothing that needs to be done to prevent
the parent function from being called twice.

</P>
<P>
Copying, cloning, and making a new token of the given type are also
supported in the <B>taBase</B> class.  The <CODE>Copy</CODE> function performs
the basic copy operations for both the copy constructor and the <CODE>=</CODE>
operator.  This should replace the values of this class and any of its
existing sub-objects with those of the object passed to it, as it is
intended for assignment between two existing objects.  In general, the
<CODE>=</CODE> operator should be used for copying all members, except for the
case of <CODE>LINK_GROUP</CODE> groups and lists, which should use the
<CODE>BorrowUnique</CODE> function (since they do not own the items in the list,
just link them).  <CODE>Copy</CODE> must call the parent's <CODE>Copy</CODE>
function as well.  As a minor simplification of calling the parent (and
to provide a copy function for just the items in a given class), it is
conventional to define a <CODE>Copy_</CODE> function, which does everything
except for calling the parent copy function.  The macro <CODE>COPY_FUNS</CODE>
can be used to define a <CODE>Copy</CODE> function which calls the parent
function and then <CODE>Copy_</CODE>.  The macro <CODE>SIMPLE_COPY</CODE> defines a
<CODE>Copy_</CODE> function which uses the type-scanned information to do the
copying.  It is slower than hand-coding things, so it probably shouldn't
be used on types which will have a lot of tokens or be copied often.

</P>
<P>
A <CODE>Clone</CODE> function which returns a <CODE>TAPtr</CODE> to a new duplicate
of this object is defined in <CODE>TA_BASEFUNS</CODE>, as well as an "unsafe"
version of <CODE>Copy</CODE> (<CODE>UnSafeCopy</CODE>), which takes a generic
<CODE>TAPtr</CODE> argument and casts it into their type.  The argument's type
should thus be tested before calling this function.  A safe interface to
this function is provided by the <CODE>CopyFrom</CODE> function, which does
the type checking.  Finally, the <CODE>MakeToken</CODE> function will create a
new token of the type.

</P>
<P>
The <B>taBase</B> class also contains functions for creating and
manipulating a structure hierarchy of objects.  This is where certain
objects contain groups of other objects, which contain other objects,
etc.  For example, the PDP++ software has a structure hierarchy built
around a root object, which contains projects, which contain lots of
other objects like networks, projects, environments, etc.  Special
container objects like <B>taList</B> and <B>taGroup</B> play an important role
in representing and manipulating this structure (note that it is
possible to write other types of container objects which could play the
same role simply by overloading the same functions that these objects
do).

</P>
<P>
When an object is "linked" into the object hierarchy, a function called
<CODE>InitLinks</CODE> is called.  This function should perform any kind of
initialization that depends on the object being situated in the
hierarchy, like being able to know what object "owns" this one.
<B>taBase</B> has functions for getting and setting the owner of an object.
For example, when a group (<B>taList</B> or <B>taGroup</B> creates a new
object and links it into its list of objects, it calls the
<CODE>SetOwner</CODE> function with a pointer to itself on this new object,
and then it calls <CODE>InitLinks</CODE>.  Similarly, when the object is
removed from the group, the <CODE>CutLinks</CODE> function is called, which
should cut any links that the object has with other objects.

</P>
<P>
An object's location in the object hierarchy can be represented by a
<EM>path</EM> to that object from a global root object.  A given
application is assumed to have a root object, which contains all other
objects.  A pointer to that object is kept in <B>tabMisc::root</B>, which
is used to anchor the path to any given object.  An object can find its
path with the <CODE>GetPath</CODE> function, and an object can be found from a
path with the <CODE>FindFromPath</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
Finally, a function for allowing an object to set the values of certain
members based on changes that might have been made in other members
after a user edits the object, called <CODE>UpdateAfterEdit</CODE>, is
provided.  This function is called on most objects after they are loaded
from a save file (except those with the <CODE>#NO_UPDATE_AFTER</CODE> comment
directive), and on all objects after the user hits <I>Apply</I> or <I>Ok</I>
in an edit dialog, and after any member is set through a CSS assign
statement.  While the object does not know which members were changed
when <CODE>UpdateAfterEdit</CODE> is called, the object can buffer previous
state on its own to figure this out if it is needed.
