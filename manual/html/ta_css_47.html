PDP++ relies on your window manager for positioning, and iconifying the
graphical windows of the program. Please refer to your window manager's
manual for more information on the mouse movements and button presses
needed to accomplish these tasks. For all the window objects in PDP++
there are CSS commands which ask the window manager to position or
iconify the windows associated with the object. It is up to the window
manager to provide the correct behavior for these "hints". PDP++ WinBase
Window's position and iconification status can be manipulated with the
following commands:
