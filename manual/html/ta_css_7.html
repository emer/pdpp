<H2><A HREF="ta_css_toc.html">5.1  Introduction to CSS</A></H2>

<P>
CSS is a "C" language interpreter and script language (C Super-Script).
The name derives from the fact that the language is C, written in C, so
it is C to the C, or C^c, while at the same time being an excellent,
even superlative scripting language.  The actual syntax for CSS is
somewhere in between C and C++, and the language is written entirely in
C++.  The major differences between CSS and C++ are listed in
section <A HREF="ta_css_13.html">5.3.1  Differences Between CSS and C++</A>, and the few discrepancies between CSS and C are
noted in section <A HREF="ta_css_14.html">5.3.2  Differences Between CSS and ANSI C</A>.  Some of the convenient features of C++ that
are incorporated into CSS are enumerated in section <A HREF="ta_css_16.html">5.3.4  Features of C++ for C Programmers</A>, for
those unfamiliar with C++.

</P>
<P>
Being an interpreter, CSS presents the user with a prompt: <CODE>css&#62;</CODE>.
At this prompt, the user can enter any C expression, which will be
evaluated immediately upon pressing Return, or enter a command.  The
commands operate much like a debugger (e.g., gdb, dbx), and allow
control over the running, listing, and debugging of programs.  In
addition to the default "immediate mode" behavior of the system, it
can behave like a compiler.  For example, the command <CODE>define</CODE> will
cause the system to enter a compiling mode (the prompt changes to
<CODE>css\# </CODE>), where the C code that is subsequently entered is
compiled into an intermediate machine code, but not run directly.
Instead, it becomes a stored program that can be run many times.

</P>
<P>
Typically, one works with a program file (use the extension .css to
indicate a css file) that is loaded and then run, instead of manually
typing programs into the system using define mode.  The command
<CODE>load "filename.css"</CODE> will load a file and compile it, at which
point it can be run.  The command <CODE>run</CODE> will run the program from
the beginning.  <CODE>reload</CODE> will remove the existing compiled program
and load (and re-compile) the previously loaded one from the disk file,
which is handy when you are editing the program file and testing it out.

</P>
<P>
One can view the source code within CSS by using the <CODE>list</CODE>
command, which takes (optional) line number and length arguments.
Unlike C functions, which need to be called with the usual syntax of
parentheses around the arguments, which are themselves comma separated,
and the whole thing is terminated by a semi-colon, the arguments to
commands don't require the parentheses or the semi-colon, but do require
thte commas.

</P>
<P>
One of the principle uses of CSS is as an interface for hard-coded C/C++
programs.  There is a "TypeAccess" program that reads the header files
for a given application and generates type information that can be used
by CSS to automatically interface with the objects and types in the
hard-coded world.  CSS comes initially with some relevant hard-coded
types from the standard C/C++ library, including a String class and the
stream I/O classes, and various math and posix library functions.
