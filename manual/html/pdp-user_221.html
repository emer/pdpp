The core set of Cs processes consist of a <B>CsTrial</B> process that
performs the two phases of contrastive Hebbian learning (CHL), where
each phase of settling is controlled by a <B>CsSettle</B> process, which in
turn iterates over a number of individual <B>CsCycle</B> processing steps,
each of which updates the activation state of the network.  These
processes fit nicely within the standard settling and cycle processes
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_153.html">12.4  Schedule Processes for Different Time-Grains</A>).

</P>
<P>
In addition, the <B>CsSample</B> process can be used to sample over trials
in order to obtain a better sampling of activation states for weight
updating, which is usually only necessary when trying to match a
probabalistic output distribution (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_227.html">15.7  The Probability Environment and Cs</A>).  It is created
by default if using the <TT>`cs_prob_env.def'</TT> defaults file, but not
otherwise. 

</P>
<P>
The <B>CsTrial</B> process iterates over two loops of settle processing,
one for each phase.  It has the following variables:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Counter phase_no</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1374"></A>
The counter for this process, it goes from 1 to 2 for the two
different phases.
<DT><CODE>Phase phase</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1375"></A>
The phase the process is in, which is just a more readable
version of the counter:  <CODE>MINUS_PHASE</CODE> and <CODE>PLUS_PHASE</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>StateInit trial_init</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1376"></A>
Indicates what to do at the start of each trial process.
Typically, one wants to <CODE>INIT_STATE</CODE>, but it is also possible to
<CODE>DO_NOTHING</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY_STATE</CODE>, which could be redefined by a
unit type to decay the activation state, for example (by default it just
does an init state).
<DT><CODE>bool no_plus_stats</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1377"></A>
This flag means that statistics will not be recorded in the plus phase.
This is useful because squared error, for example, is only meaningful in
the minus phase, since the correct answer is clamped in the plus phase.
<DT><CODE>bool no_plus_test</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1378"></A>
This flag means that the plus phase will not be run if the epoch process
indicates that it is in <CODE>TEST</CODE> mode (i.e., no learning is taking
place).
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1379"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1380"></A>

The <B>CsSettle</B> process iterates over cycles of settling (activation
updating).  Like the <CODE>trial_init</CODE> of the trial process, the
<CODE>between_phases</CODE> field of the settle process determines how the
network state will be initialized between phases.  Some people have
claimed that learning works better if you do not <CODE>INIT_STATE</CODE>
between phases (<CITE>Movellan, 1990</CITE>).  However, the default is set to
initialize the state, so that settling starts from the same initial
conditions for both phases.

</P>
<P>
Also, the settle process allows the network to settle for some time
before collecting statistics for learning.  This time, determined by the
<CODE>start_stats</CODE> parameter, allows the network to get into a
stochastic equilibrium before measuring the activation states.  If using
a deterministic network, however, equilibrium is considered to simply be
the final state of the network after settling.  Setting the
<CODE>deterministic</CODE> flag will only update the weights based on the
final activation state.

</P>
<P>
The settle process will use the <CODE>time</CODE> field from a <B>TimeEvent</B>
as a <EM>duration</EM> to settle on the event.  Note that this is a
non-standard use of this time field (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_212.html">14.2.5  RBp Sequence Processes and TimeEvents</A>).

</P>
<P>

The <B>CsCycle</B> process updates the activation state of the network.
This can be done in one of two ways -- either all of the units are
updated simultaneously (<CODE>SYNCHRONOUS</CODE> mode), or units are selected
at random and updated one at a time, which is <CODE>ASYNCHRONOUS</CODE> mode.
If the asynchronous mode is selected, one can perform multiple
asynchronous updates per cycle.  The number of units updated is
determined by the <CODE>n_updates</CODE> variable.  Note that the total number
of updates performed is the product of <CODE>n_updates</CODE> and the number
of cycles made during settling, so be sure to take that into account
when setting the values of either of these parameters.

</P>
<P>
A variation of the synchronous mode is the <CODE>SYNC_SENDER_BASED</CODE>
mode, which must be selected if IACUnitSpec's are being used, and the
<CODE>use_send_thresh</CODE> flag is set.  In this case, net input is computed
in a sender-based fashion, meaning that the net input for each unit must
first be initialized to zero, then accumulated.  In standard
receiver-based net input computation, the net input can be reset at the
point an individual unit's net input is computed, so it doesn't have to
be done for the entire network first.  This is the different between
SYNC_SENDER_BASED and SYNCHRONOUS.  Asynchronous updating is not
supported for sender-based updating.  When the <B>CsTrial</B> process is
<I>ReInit</I>'d or <I>NewInit</I>'d, it will automatically check for the
correct pairing of the use_send_thresh and update_mode flags, and inform
you if it needs to be changed.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1384"></A>
The <B>CsSample</B> process has <CODE>sample</CODE> counter to keep track of the
number of samples run.  Set the <CODE>max</CODE> of this counter to 1 if you
are running a deterministic network, or are not doing learning on
probability distributions.  This process iterates over the trial
process, and only needs to be present when learning probabalistic output
distributions.
