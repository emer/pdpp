<H2><A NAME="IDX553" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">10.1  The Network Object</A></H2>

<P>
The network object is basically a container for all the things that go
in it.  Thus, it has a group of layers, which then contain units,
projections, etc.  In addition, each network also has an epoch counter
and a variable controlling the default layout of the layers.  The epoch
counter reflects the number of <EM>training</EM> epochs the network has
seen (not testing). Finally, the network is instantiated in the user
interface by one or more <B>NetView</B>s, which provide a window with menu
actions, tools, etc. to operate on the network.

</P>
<P>
Also see the following information about Networks:

</UL>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Layer_MGroup layers</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX554"></A>
This is the group of layers that have been created in the network.  The
layers then contain all of the remaining substructure of the network.
<DT><CODE>int epoch</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
The epoch counter indicates how many epochs of training the network has
been subjected to. This counter is incremented by the training processes
which act upon it, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_156.html">12.4.3  Iterating over Trials: EpochProcess</A>.
<DT><CODE>bool re_init</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX556"></A>
This flag is set by training schedule process to indicate whether the
network should be reinitialized when the process is initialized
section <A HREF="pdp-user_155.html">12.4.2  Iterating over Epochs: TrainProcess</A>.
<DT><CODE>LayerLayout lay_layout</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX557"></A>
This variable can be set to either <CODE>TWO_D</CODE> or <CODE>THREE_D</CODE>. It
controls the default positioning of the layers when they are created,
as well as the skew of the units when they are displayed.  <CODE>TWO_D</CODE>
networks are arranged in one big X-Y grid, while <CODE>THREE_D</CODE> networks
simulate a three-dimensional space where successive layers are located
at successively higher Z coordinates, and units within a layer are
arranged in an X-Y plane.
<DT><CODE>Usr1SaveFmt usr1_save_fmt</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX558"></A>
You can control how the network is saved when it receives the
<CODE>USR1</CODE> signal (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_106.html">9.4  Signals to Control a PDP++ Process</A>) with this -- the full network
or just the weights
<DT><CODE>PThreadSpec pthread</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX559"></A>
<A NAME="IDX560"></A>
<A NAME="IDX561"></A>
<A NAME="IDX562"></A>
This specifies parameters for parallel processing (SMP) of the network.
Number of processors (threads) is specified by the <B>n_threads</B>
parameter.  This works by compiling a list of layers for each thread to
process, based on the number of connections and units in the layers
(separate list for each).  The allocation algorithm tries to distribute
the computation as evenly as possible.  This is relatively fine-grained
parallelism, and due to the overhead involved in managing the threads,
it only speeds up relatively large networks (i.e., &#62; 50 units per layer,
&#62;= 4 layers).  Speedups can by upwards of 1.67 times as fast on dual
pentium III systems.  You can also restrict parallelism to only
connection-level computations by turning off <B>par_units</B> -- unit
level speedup is typically quite quite small (but measurable..).

</DL>

<P>
The network also has the following functions which can be activated by
the corresponding menu selection in the <B>NetView</B> (<B>using the left
hand menu</B>).

</P>
<P>
In the <I>Object</I> menu:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ReadOldPDPNet(File input_file, bool skip_dots)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>Copy_Weights()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX563"></A>
Copies the weights from another similarly-configured network.  By
duplicating a network and then later copying weights back from it, one
can restore weight values to known values while tinkering with various
parameters affecting network learning.
<DT><CODE>WriteWeights(File output_file)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX564"></A>
Outputs bias and receiver weight values in a unit by unit format to a
file (includes comments). NOTE: This is not the same format as the old
pdp software.
<DT><CODE>ReadWeights(File input_file)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX565"></A>
Loads in the bias and receiver weight values from a file created with
the WriteWeights function above.
<A NAME="IDX566"></A>
Reads in a "filename.net" type file format from the old pdp software.
<VAR>skip_dots</VAR> indicates whether to skip over "." values in the
"network:" weight matrix section or to create zero valued weights
instead. This function will attempt to use and extend existing network
structure if it exists and create new network structure if necessary.
Currently (v1.2) it does not handle "Bias:" sections or "LINKED" weight
constraints. 
</DL>

<P>
In the <I>Actions</I> menu:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Build()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX567"></A>
Create units in all the layers according to the size and shape of the
layers.  If units already exist, it makes sure they are of the right
type, and arranged within the geometry of the layer.  This is accessed
through the <I>Build All</I> button of the <B>NetView</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_129.html">10.6  Network Viewer</A>).
<DT><CODE>Connect()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX568"></A>
Create connections on all the units according to the projections on the
layers.  The projections define a pattern of connectivity, and the
connections actually flesh this pattern out by individually connecting
unit to unit.  Note that any existing connections are removed before
connecting. This is accessed through the <I>Connect All</I> button of the
<B>NetView</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_129.html">10.6  Network Viewer</A>).
<DT><CODE>Check Types()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX569"></A>
Checks to make sure all the objects and specs in the network are
mutually compatible.
<DT><CODE>Fix Prjn Indexes()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX570"></A>
Fixes the other_idx indexes on the connection groups -- CheckTypes
might tell you you need to run this if your network was not properly
connected.
<DT><CODE>RemoveCons()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX571"></A>
Remove all the connections on the units in the network.  Like
<CODE>RemoveUnits</CODE> this is useful for reducing the size of the network
for saving.
<DT><CODE>RemoveUnits()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX572"></A>
Remove all the units from the network.  This can be useful for saving
large networks, since all of the relevant structural information for
rebuilding the network is typically present in the layers and
projections.  Thus, one can save the "skeleton" and then simply press
<I>Build All</I> and <I>Connect All</I> when the network is reloaded.
<DT><CODE>InitState()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX573"></A>
Initialize the state variables on the units.  This means activation-like
variables, but not the weights.
<DT><CODE>InitWtState()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX574"></A>
Initialize the weight state information on the connections in accordance
with their <B>ConSpecs</B>.  This also resets the epoch counter to zero.
<DT><CODE>TransformWeights(PreProcessVals trans)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX575"></A>
Applies given transformation to weights.  Possible transformations
include basic arithmetic operators (e.g., scaling via multiplication),
and absolute value, thresholding, etc.
<DT><CODE>AddNoiseToWeights(Random noise_spec)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX576"></A>
Adds noise to weights using given noise specification.  This can be
useful for simulating damage to the network.
<DT><CODE>PruneCons(PreProcessVals pre_proc, CountParam::Relation rel, float cmp_val)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX577"></A>
Removes connections that (after a pre-processing transformation,
e.g. absolute-value) meet the given relation in comparison to compare
val (e.g., LESSTHANOREQUAL to some value).
<DT><CODE>LesionCons(float p_lesion, bool permute)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
Removes connections with probability p_lesion.  If permute is true, then
a fixed number of weights will be lesioned, where this number is equal
to the probablility times the number of weights.  Othewise, the actual
number of weights lesioned will vary based on the probability.
<DT><CODE>LesionUnits(float p_lesion, bool permute)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX579"></A>
Removes units with probability p_lesion.  If permute is true, then a
fixed number of units will be lesioned, where this number is equal to
the probablility times the number of units (on a layer-by-layer basis).
Othewise, the actual number of units lesioned will vary based on the
probability.
<DT><CODE>TwoD_Or_ThreeD(LayerLayout layout_type)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX580"></A>
Reposition the units and layers in either a 2D or 3D configuration.
<DT><CODE>GridViewWeights(GridLog* grid_log, Layer* recv_lay, Layer* send_lay, int un_x, un_y, wt_x, wt_y)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX581"></A>
Plots the entire set of weights into the recv_lay from the send_lay in
the grid log specified (NULL = make a new one).  The un_x, un_y
parameters can specify a more limited range of receiving units (-1 means
entire layer), and the wt_x, wt_y similarly specify a more limited range
of sending units (weights).
</DL>

<P>
These other functions of the network might be useful to those writing
scripts or programming in PDP++:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ConnectUnits(Unit* receiving_unit, Unit* sending_unit);</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX582"></A>
Creates a connection from the sending_unit to the receiving_unit. A
custom projection between the units' layers is created if necessary
</DL>

<P>
Finally there are a number of other functions that can be found in
<TT>`src/pdp/netstru.h'</TT> which are useful for programming.  In general the
Network has a function corresponding to one that is performed on a
lower-level object like a unit, and this function on the network simply
calls the corresponding one on all of its layers, which then call the
one on all of their units, etc.
