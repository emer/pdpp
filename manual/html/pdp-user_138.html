<P>
Note that layer pointer in a pattern spec depends on which network the
environment is being applied to.  Thus, there is some checking that
takes place when an event is being applied to the network to make sure
that the layer pointers are up-to-date.  Along these same lines, any
time the events or patterns are edited, the layer pointers are reset,
with the idea being that they might have changed where the patterns are
being applied to.

<P>
The basic set of functions can be found in the <TT>`src/pdp/enviro.h'</TT>
file.  They are fairly straightforward.
