<H3><A NAME="IDX1285" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">14.2.3  RBp Unit Specifications</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1286"></A>

</P>
<P>
The unit-level specifications contain most of the RBp-specific
parameters, although some important ones are also present in the
<B>RBpTrial</B> process.  Note that the <CODE>dt</CODE> parameter should be the
same for all unit specs used in a given network.  Also, this parameter
is copied automatically to the <B>RBpTrial</B> process, which also needs to
know the value of this parameter.  Thus, the unit spec is the place to
change <CODE>dt</CODE>, not the trial process.

</P>
<P>
The unit object in RBp is essentially the same as the <B>BpUnit</B>, except
for the addition of variables to hold the previous values of all the
state variables, and special circular buffers to hold the entire record
of activation state variables over the update trajectory.  These are
described in greater detail in section <A HREF="pdp-user_216.html">14.2.9  RBp Implementation Details</A>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>float dt</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1288"></A>
Controls the time-grain of activation settling and error
backpropagation as described above.  In <CODE>ACTIVATION</CODE> mode, the
activations are updated towards the raw activation value computed as a
sigmoid function of the current net input by an amount proportional to
<CODE>dt</CODE>:
<PRE>    u-&#62;da = dt * (u-&#62;act_raw - u-&#62;prv_act);
    u-&#62;act = u-&#62;prv_act + u-&#62;da;
</PRE>

Similarly, in <CODE>NET_INPUT</CODE> mode, the net-inputs are moved towards
the current raw net input proportional to the size of <CODE>dt</CODE>:
<PRE>    u-&#62;da = dt * (u-&#62;net - u-&#62;prv_net);
    u-&#62;net = u-&#62;prv_net + u-&#62;da;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>TimeAvgType time_avg</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1289"></A>
Controls the type of time-averaging to be performed.
<CODE>ACTIVATION</CODE> based time-averaging, as shown above, adapts the
current activations towards the raw activation based on the current net
input, while <CODE>NET_INPUT</CODE> based time-averaging, also shown above,
adapts the net input towards the current raw value.  The latter is
generally preferred since it allows networks with large weights to update
activations quickly compared to activation-based updates, which have a
strict ceiling on the update rate since the maximum activation value is
1, while the maximum net input value is unbounded.
<DT><CODE>bool soft_clamp</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1290"></A>
Soft clamping refers to the application of an environmental input to the
network as simply an additional term in the unit's net input, as opposed
to a hard-clamped pre-determined activation value.  Soft clamping allows
input units to behave a little more like hidden units, in that raw
inputs are only one source of influence on their activation values.
<DT><CODE>float soft_clamp_gain</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1291"></A>
A strength multiplier that can be used to set the level of
influence that the inputs have in soft-clamp mode.  This allows the user
to use the same environments for hard and soft clamping, while still
giving the soft-clamp values stronger influence on the net input than
would be the case if only 0-1 values were being contributed by the
external input.
<DT><CODE>bool teacher_force</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1292"></A>
A modification of the RBp algorithm where the activation values are
"forced" to be as given by the teaching (target) values.  Given that the
error is backpropagated over a long series of time steps, this can help
error on previous time steps be computed as if the later time steps were
actually correct, which might help in the bootstrapping of
representations that will be appropriate when the network actually is
performing correctly.
<DT><CODE>bool store_states</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1293"></A>
This flag determines if activity states are stored over time for use in
performing a backpropagation through them later.  This usually must be
true, except in the Almeida-Pineda algorithm, or when just testing the
network.
<DT><CODE>Random initial_act</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1294"></A>
Sets the parameters for the initialization of activation states at
the beginning of a sequence.  This state forms the 0th element of the
sequence of activations.
