The following functions are available on the <B>Environment</B> object
(in the <I>Analyze</I> menu) for analyzing the patterns in the
environment.  Some of these functions can also be called from the
<B>Log</B> objects in their own <I>Analyze</I> menu
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_185.html">13.3.1  The LogView Class</A>), and by the <B>DispDataEnvProc</B> process
that automatically analyzes data collected in an environment from a
statistic (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_166.html">12.6.5  Miscellaneous other Process Types</A>).

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DistMatrix(ostream&#38; strm, int pat_no, metric, norm, tol, format, precision)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX846"></A>
This produces a distance matrix between all events for given pattern to
a file specified by strm.  The metric and associated parameters
determine how distance is computed.  Norm is whether to normalize entire
distance, and tol is a unit-wise tolerance, below which dist = 0.  The
output format can be varied according to the format and precision
parameters.
<DT><CODE>DistMatrixGrid(GridLog* disp_log, metric, norm, tol)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX847"></A>
This produces a distance matrix between all events for given pattern,
and sends it to the given GridLog for immediate display (if NULL, a new
GridLog is created).  
<DT><CODE>CmpDistMatrix(ostream&#38; strm, int pat_no, Environment* cmp_env, int cmp_pat_no, metric, norm, tol, format)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX848"></A>
This produces a distance matrix between all events across two different
environments, for given pattern on each.
<DT><CODE>CmpDistMatrixGrid(ostream&#38; strm, int pat_no, Environment* cmp_env, int cmp_pat_no, metric, norm, tol, format)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX849"></A>
This produces a distance matrix between all events across two different
environments, for given pattern on each, and displays the results in a
grid log.
<DT><CODE>ClusterPlot(GraphLog* disp_log, int pat_no, metric, norm, tol)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX850"></A>
This produces a cluster plot of the distance matrix between all events
for given pattern, and sends it to the given GraphLog for immediate
display.  The clusterplot recursively groups the most similar items
together, and uses the average of the individual cluster element
distances to compute the distance to a cluster, instead of computing
an average vector for a cluster and using that to compute distances.
This makes the algorithm somewhat more computationally intensive, but
also produces nicer results (the distance metric is cached so
distances are only computed once, so it should handle relatively large
numbers of events).
<DT><CODE>CorrelMatrixGrid(GridLog* disp_log, int pat_no)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX851"></A>
Generates a correlation matrix for all patterns in <CODE>pat_no</CODE> in
the environment and plots the result in grid log (NULL = new log).
The correlation matrix is defined by taking a vector of each pattern
value (e.g., the first element in the pattern) across all events, and
computing the correlation of this vector of values with those of all
the other such value vectors.  As such, it measures the degree to
which the variation of one pattern value (across events) correlates
with the variation of another pattern value (across events).
<DT><CODE>PCAEigenGrid(GridLog* disp_log, int pat_no, bool print_eigen_vals)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX852"></A>
Performs principal components analysis (PCA) of the correlations of
patterns in <CODE>pat_no</CODE> across events, plotting all eigenvectors in the
grid log (NULL = new log).  The eigenvectors are the orthogonal
components of the correlations ordered in terms of how much
variability they account for.  The first principal component
(eigenvector) accounts for the greatest amount of variability in the
correlation matrix, etc.  Note that the eigenvectors are arranged from
left-to-right, bottom-to-top, such that the first component is at the
bottom-left.
<DT><CODE>PCAPrjnPlot(GraphLog* disp_log, int pat_no, int x_axis_component, int y_axis_component, bool print_eigen_vals)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX853"></A>
Performs principal components analysis of the correlations of patterns
in <CODE>pat_no</CODE> across events, and then plots projections of all the
patterns onto two of the principal components in the graph log (NULL =
new log).  This provides a means of representing the similarities of
the different patterns with each other in a two-dimensional space.
The X-axis of the graph represents how similar the patterns are along
the first selected component, and the Y-axis represents how similar
they are along the second selected component.
<DT><CODE>MDSPrjnPlot(GraphLog* disp_log, int pat_no, int x_axis_component, int y_axis_component, metric, norm, tol, bool print_eigen_vals)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX854"></A>
Performs multidimensional scaling (MDS) on the distance matrix
(computed according to metric, norm, tol parameters) of patterns in
pat_no across events in the graph log (NULL = new log).
Multidimensional scaling takes a set of dissimilarities and returns a
set of points such that the distances between the points are
approximately equal to the dissimilarities.  The results of this are
typically very similar to PCA, even though the method is somewhat
different, operating on the distance matrix instead of the correlation
matrix.  The classical (metric) form of MDS is used, computed
according to the algorithm developed by Torgerson, W. S. (1958).

the <TT>`cmdscale.R'</TT> function from the <B>R</B> statistical program.
<DT><CODE>EventPrjnPlot(Event* x_axis_event, Event* y_axis_event, int pat_no, GraphLog* disp_log, metric, norm, tol)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX855"></A>
Projects all events according to their smiliarity to the two specified
events using given distance metrics.  This allows one to obtain a 2-d
plot of the similarity of all events to two selected events.
<DT><CODE>EnvToGrid(GridLog* disp_log, int pat_no, ev_x, y, pt_x, y)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX856"></A>
This dumps the entire set of events worth of a given pattern into a grid
log for more efficient viewing and for more control over the display
layout.  The ev_x, ev_y parameters control the geometry of the events,
and the pt_x, pt_y control the geometry of the pattern values within
each event.
<DT><CODE>PatFreqText(float act_thresh, bool proportion, ostream&#38; strm)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX857"></A>
Reports frequency (proportion) of pattern values greater than
act_thresh across events, to a text output (this is most useful if
pattern values are named in value_names).  This can be useful for
verifying that an environment has expected probabilities of different
inputs. 
<DT><CODE>PatFreqGrid(GridLog* disp_log, float act_thresh, bool proportion)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX858"></A>
Reports frequency (proportion) of pattern values greater than
act_thresh across events, to a grid log (if NULL, new log is made).
<DT><CODE>PatAggText(Aggregate&#38; agg, ostream&#38; strm)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX859"></A>
Reports aggregate (SUM, AVG, etc) of pattern values across events, to
a text output (this is most useful if pattern values are named in
value_names).  This can be useful for identifying the overall
properties of events.
<DT><CODE>PatAggGrid(GridLog* disp_log, float act_thresh, bool proportion)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX860"></A>
Reports aggregate (SUM, AVG, etc) of pattern values across events, to
a grid log (NULL = make a new log).  This can be useful for
identifying the overall properties of events.
<DT><CODE>EventFreqText(bool proportion, ostream&#38; strm)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX861"></A>
Reports frequency (proportion) of event names in the environment.
Also useful for validating that the environment contains what you
think it should.
