<P>
<A NAME="IDX1295"></A>

</P>
<P>
In order to accommodate both the real-time and discrete sequence-based
processing modes of RBp, the lowest level of processing in RBp is still
the Trial, just as in regular Bp.  Thus, each cycle of activation update
is performed by the trial.  In addition, the trial process looks at the
number of stored activation states that have been accumulated in the
network's units, and if this is equal to the time-window over which
backprop is supposed to occur, the trial process will then perform a
backpropagation through all of these stored activation states.  Thus,
the scheduling of backpropagations is fairly autonomous, which makes
real-time mode work well.  When not operating in real-time mode, the
time-window for error backpropagation is automatically set to be the
total duration of the current sequence.  This makes it easy to use
variable length sequences, etc.

</P>
<P>
The distinction between whether the network is trained in real-time or
sequence-based mode is based on the kinds of processes that are created
above the level of the <B>RBpTrial</B> process, and on the setting of the
<CODE>real_time</CODE> flag on the <B>RBpTrial</B> process itself.  If using the
sequence-based mode, where backpropagations are performed at the end of
discrete sequences of events, then the user should create a
Sequence-based process hierarchy, which includes a <B>SequenceEpoch</B>, an
<B>RBpSequence</B> process, and finally a <B>RBpTrial</B> process.  If one is
using real-time mode, only a regular <B>EpochProcess</B> and a <B>RBpTrial</B>
process need to be used.

</P>
<P>
The following parameters are available on the <B>RBpTrial</B>.  Note that
all of the parameters are expressed in terms of the abstract time units,
and not in terms of the specific ticks of the discrete clock on which
the actual events are presented to the network, activations are updated,
etc.  This makes the parameters invariant with respect to changes in
<CODE>dt</CODE>, which controls the size of a tick of discrete time.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>float time</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1297"></A>
The current time, relative to the start of the most recent
sequence, or since the units were last initialized if in real-time mode.
It is a read-only variable.
<DT><CODE>float dt</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1298"></A>
The delta-time increment, which is copied automatically from the
units in the network.  It is used in updating the time in the trial
process.
<DT><CODE>float time_window</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1299"></A>
Determines the time window over which error
backpropagation will be performed.  Thus, units will hold their
activation states for this long before a backpropagation will occur.
<DT><CODE>float bp_gap</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1300"></A>
The time to wait in between successive backpropagations after
an initial activation settling time of <CODE>time_window</CODE> in duration.
This is used primarily in real-time mode, and controls the amount of
overlap between successive backpropagations.  For example, a
<CODE>time_window</CODE> of 4 and a <CODE>bp_gap</CODE> of 2 would result in the
following schedule of backpropagations:
<PRE>time:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
bp:           x   x   x
</PRE>

where each backprop goes back 4 time steps, resulting in an overlap of 2
time steps for each backprop.
<DT><CODE>bool real_time</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1301"></A>
Checking this flag will cause the network to shift the activation
buffers after each backpropagation, so that the appropriate amount of
activation state information will be available for the next
backpropagation (i.e., it shifts them by the size of <CODE>bp_gap</CODE>).  Not
checking this flag will cause the <CODE>time_window</CODE> to be automatically
set to the length of the current sequence.
