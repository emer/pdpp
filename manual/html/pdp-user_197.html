Backpropagation is perhaps the most commonly used neural network
learning algorithm.  Several different "flavors" of backpropagation have
been developed over the years, several of which have been implemented in
the PDP++ software, including the use of different error functions such
as cross-entropy, and recurrent backprop, from the simple recurrent
network to the Almeida-Pineda algorithm up to the real-time continuous
recurrent backprop.  The implementation allows the user to extend the
unit types to use different activation and error functions in a
straightforward manner.

Note that the simple recurrent networks (SRN, a.k.a. Elman networks) are
described in the feedforward backprop section, as they are more like
feedforward networks than the fully recurrent ones.
