<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.2.8  Running the Processes</A></H3>

<P>
To run a process, we first create a 'control panel' window for it.
Select <I>.processes</I> / <I>ControlPanel</I> / <I>Train</I> in the <B>Project</B>
window; this creates a control panel for running the <B>TrainProcess</B>.
At this point, if you were to click on <I>Run</I> (don't do it now!), the
network will proceed to run epochs, until either the stopping criterion
is met or <CODE>max</CODE> epochs (shown in the <CODE>max</CODE> typein box) are
completed.

</P>
<P>
Rather than start training right away, let's run through a test before
any training is carried out.  We can do this using the "Test" process,
which is actually just another <B>EpochProcess</B> that is set up to run
one epoch without learning.  Select <I>.processes</I> / <I>ControlPanel</I> /
<I>Test</I> in the <B>Project</B> window, then simply press <I>Step</I>.  Now,
you will see some action.  First, assuming that <I>act</I> is selected in
the <B>NetView</B>, you will see the activations of all of the units as the
first pattern is processed.  The input units are both off (0) in the
first pattern, and should have the color associated with 0 in the color
scale.  The hidden and output units all have activations between about
0.4 and 0.6.  The same information is displayed in the <B>GridLogView</B>.
You should see the epoch number, the Event name, the sum-squared error
for this event, and a display showing the activation of the hidden and
output units for this event.  If you press <I>Step</I> 3 more times you can
step through the remaining test patterns.  At the end of stepping you
should have the results from all four cases visible in the GridLogView.

</P>
<P>
Now let's run 30 epochs of training and see what happens.  To do this,
just click on <I>Step</I> in the "Train" control panel, which is pre-set to
run 30 epochs in each step (as indicated by the value of <CODE>n</CODE> in the
control panel <CODE>step</CODE> field).  When you do this, assuming that
indeed the <I>act</I> button has been clicked in the <B>NetView</B>, you will
see the state of activation in the network flicker through all four
patterns thirty times.  At the end of each epoch the total sum of
squares will be displayed in the <B>GraphLogView</B> -- the results are
pretty dismal at first, with a sum of sum-of-squares-error
(<CODE>sum_sum_se</CODE>) oscillating a bit very close to 1.

</P>
<P>
After 30 epochs you can run through another test if you want, either
stepping through the patterns one at a time as before with the <I>Step</I>
button or running a complete test of all of the items with the <I>Run</I>
button.  If you hit <I>Run</I> the results will flicker by rather fast in
the <B>NetView</B> but again all four cases will be logged in the
<B>GridLogView</B>.  You can see that the activations of the hidden and
output units are very similar across all four cases.

</P>
<P>
You can proceed to taking successive steps of 30 epochs, then testing,
if you like, or, if you prefer, you can simply let the learning process
run to criterion, and then run a test only at that point.  To do the
latter, just hit <I>Run</I> in the "Train" control panel.  You can click
off the <I>Display</I> toggle in the <B>NetView</B> (near the upper left) ---
this will speed things up a bit, even though the <B>GraphLogView</B> will
still be adding new data after each epoch.

</P>
<P>
As with the example of learning XOR from the original PDP handbook, not
much happens to the sum of sum-squared-error (<CODE>sum_sum_se</CODE>) until
about epoch 160 or so.  Now the error begins to drop, slowly at first,
then faster... until at about 270 epochs the stopping criterion is
reached, and the problem is solved.  Hit <I>Step</I> in the "Test" control
panel, to step through a test at this point.  You should be able to see
either in the <B>NetView</B> or in the <B>GridLogView</B> that the units that
should be off are close to off (less than about .1) and the units that
should be on are most of the way on (activation about .9).

</P>
<P>
If you would like to let the network learn to get the activations even
closer to the correct values, you'll need to change the stopping
criterion.  This criterion is associated with the sum of
sum-squared-error statistic (<CODE>lst_sum_SE_Stat</CODE>) in the
<B>TrainProcess</B>.  To access it, select <I>.processes</I> / <I>Edit</I> /
<I>Train</I> / <I>lst_sum_Train_SE_Stat</I> from the .project window.  The
label "lst_sum_Train_SE_Stat" indicates that this <B>SE_Stat</B>
(squared-error statistic) is associated with the <B>TrainProcess</B>.  It
originates at the trial level, but its <CODE>sum</CODE> over training trials
within the epoch is passed to the epoch level, and the <CODE>lst</CODE> (last,
latest) value at the epoch level is passed to the Train process.

</P>
<P>
An edit dialog box will come up when you <I>Edit</I> it.  This may seem a
bit daunting at this point -- we're letting you see how much there is
under the hood here -- but bear with us for a moment.  All you need to
do is find the row of this dialog labeled <CODE>se</CODE>.  You'll see its
current value, a toggle indicating that it is set to serve as a stopping
criterion, a criterion-type (here less-than-or-equal or <CODE>&#60;=</CODE>), and
to the right of this a numeric criterion value (which should be 0.04).
Click in this numeric field, and set it to 0.01.

</P>
<P>
Before the new value takes effect, it must be propagated from the dialog
box to the actual internal state of the simulator.  As soon as you have
started to make change, the dialog will highlight the <I>Apply</I> button
to indicate that you need to press this button to apply any changes that
have been made to the state of the simulator.  Once you have the value
field showing the new value that you want to use, click <I>Apply</I> and
the change will be implemented.  Then click <I>Ok</I> to dismiss the window
Note that <I>Ok</I> also performs an "Apply" if necessary, so you can
actually just do this in one step.  However, often you'll want to keep a
dialog around after you make changes, which is where the <I>Apply</I>
button is useful.

</P>
<P>
Now hit <I>Run</I> again in the "Train" control panel, and the network will
run around 70 more epochs to get its performance to the new, more
stringent criterion.
