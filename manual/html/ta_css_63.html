<H1><A NAME="IDX334" HREF="ta_css_toc.html">8  Object Basics and Basic Objects</A></H1>

<P>
PDP++ is written in the computer language C++. C++ extends the C
language in many ways, but its primary addition is the concept of
objects and object oriented programming (OOP). Many PDP concepts such as
Units, Layers, and Networks easily fall into the object paradigm, while
some other concepts such as Processes and Environments are initially
difficult to grasp in this framework. The following chapters explain the
particulars of the PDP concepts in the object-based paradigm in greater
detail. This chapter establishes a number of conventions in PDP++ used
for organizing and structuring its objects.  It is really only relevant
if you will be programming with PDP++, either in the script language or
directly in C++ -- the end user generally need not be concerned with
this level of detail.

In addition to these object basics, this chapter also describes a number
of basic types of objects that are used in many different places within
the software.  Examples of these include lists, groups, arrays, and
specifications.
