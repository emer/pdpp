The base Process class provides the following variables for controlling
its behavior:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Enum type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX888"></A>
This can be either <CODE>C_CODE</CODE> or <CODE>SCRIPT</CODE>, which determines if
the Process is going to execute C code or CSS script code.  A script
file must be attached to the process to run in <CODE>SCRIPT</CODE> mode.
<DT><CODE>Modulo mod</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX889"></A>
This object controls how often a process is run.  It is applicable for
processes and statistics that are placed in either the <CODE>loop_procs</CODE>
or <CODE>loop_stats</CODE> groups of a scheduling process, and the modulo
function is based on the counter variable of that parent process.  For
<CODE>final_stats</CODE> and <CODE>final_procs</CODE>, the counter variable is that
of the parent of the parent schedule process. If the <CODE>flag</CODE>
variable of the <CODE>mod</CODE> object is not set then the process is never
run. Otherwise the process is run if the parent's counter minus the
<CODE>off</CODE> variable modulo the <CODE>m</CODE> variable is equal to zero (i.e.,
it is run every <CODE>m</CODE> times, with a phase determined by the offset
<CODE>off</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>Network* network</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX890"></A>
This is a pointer to the Network object on which the Process is acting.
This pointer is copied automatically from the parent process, so it
should be changed only at the highest level of the processing hierarchy,
which will cause it to change in all the lower-level processes.
<DT><CODE>Environment* environment</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX891"></A>
This is a pointer the Environment in which the Process acts. Like the
network pointer, it is automatically copied from higher-level processes,
and should be set at the highest level.
</DL>

<P>
The basic Process class provides the following functions for controlling
its behavior.  Some of these are available on the <I>Control Panel</I>
buttons that appear at the bottom of the edit dialog and the control
panel, and others are in the <I>Actions</I> menu.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>NewInit()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX892"></A>
Initializes the process using new random seed.  This seed is saved, and
can be recalled using the <CODE>ReInit</CODE> function, but the previously
saved seed is then lost.
<DT><CODE>ReInit()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX893"></A>
Initializes the process using the previously-saved random seed.
<DT><CODE>Run()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX894"></A>
This function checks which type of code the Process is supposed to
use (C code or script) and executes the appropriate code.
<DT><CODE>Step()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX895"></A>
Executes one step the process.  For schedule processes, this is
controlled by the <CODE>step</CODE> field, which specifies at what sub-level
of the heirarchy to step (e.g., setting step.proc to the trial process
will mean that Step executes one step of the trial process -- it
processes one event per Step).  Schedule processes also have <B>Step
Up</B> and <B>Step Dn</B> buttons that are useful for controlling the stepping
level within the process hierarchy.
<DT><CODE>Stop()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX896"></A>
Stops the process when running.
<DT><CODE>Step Up()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX897"></A>
Moves the stepping level up one step in the heirarchy (e.g., from cycle
up to settle).  Removes updating of the network by the previous stepping
level (e.g., cycle no longer updates).  This only applies to Sched
Processes. 
<DT><CODE>Step Dn()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX898"></A>
Moves the stepping level down one step in the heirarchy (e.g., from
settle to cycle).  Adds updating of the network by the new stepping
level (e.g., cycle now updates the network).  This only applies to Sched
Processes.
<DT><CODE>ControlPanel()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX899"></A>
Brings up a small control panel dialog for running the process.
<DT><CODE>LoadScript (char* filename)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX900"></A>
Sets the script file to be used by the Process to <CODE>filename</CODE> and
compiles the script for execution. This function clears any previous
script file being used by the process. It automatically sets the
<CODE>type</CODE> variable to <CODE>SCRIPT</CODE>.
