<H2><A NAME="IDX1096" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">13.2  PDPLog Functions</A></H2>

<P>
On all of the following functions, the optional no_dlg arg will prevent
the popup file requester dialog if true - this dialog comes up even when
a valid file name is specified.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Actions/GetHeaders()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1097"></A>
Tells all the processes that update this log to send their
current headers to this log.  Use this if you have changed the
statistics being sent to this log.  Note that it causes all existing
data to be removed.  The log will automatically adjust to the addition
and removal of statistics, so this isn't necessary in those cases.
However, it won't notice if a name of a statistic has changed.
<DT><CODE>LogFile/SetSaveFile(char* file_nm, bool no_dlg = false)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1098"></A>
Pulls up a file chooser dialog that allows one to select the file that
the log will save data into, or sets the log file to the argument if
called from the script language.  This does not save any existing data
in the file, it just opens the file so that any new data will be
recorded.  Use <CODE>BufferToFile</CODE> after setting the save file (or by
itself without a save file set) to actually save currently buffered data
to the file.  Note that this will overwrite any existing file of the
same name.
<DT><CODE>LogFile/SetAppendFile(char* file_nm, bool no_dlg = false)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1099"></A>
This is just like <CODE>SetSaveFile</CODE>, but it appends to an existing file
instead of writing over it.
<DT><CODE>LogFile/LoadFile(char* file_nm, bool no_dlg = false)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1100"></A>
This will load data from a previously-saved log file into this log.
Note that it is possible to load from a log file created by any process,
since it will read the header information from the log file itself.
Thus, one can open a new project, create a <B>GraphLog</B> object, and do a
Load file on a log from a project that was run in the background, and
get a graph of what happened.
<DT><CODE>LogFile/CloseFile()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1101"></A>
Closes any open files. Note that <CODE>LoadFile</CODE> does not close the
log file, because if the file is longer than the current buffer, it
needs to be read from as the user scrolls through the file.
<DT><CODE>LogFile/BufferToFile(char* file_nm, bool no_dlg = false)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1102"></A>
Sends the entire contents of the currently-buffered log data to a log
file.  If there is an open log file and no file name is specified, it
sends to this currently open file.  If there is no open file, then it
will do a SetSaveFile(file_nm, no_dlg) and then dump the buffer to the
file, closing the file afterwards.
