<P>
The GridLogView is similar to the TextLogView in that it displays from
top to bottom sequential lines of Log data. It differs however in that
the values of the data can be displayed as colored blocks similar to the
units in the NetView as well as the text output style of the
TextLogView.  

</P>
<P>
In addition, the columns of Log data can be arranged in a custom fashion
in a 2-D grid for each "line" of data. This is useful especially for
MonitorStats which generate a separate column of data for each value
recorded from the NetView.  For Example: If a MonitorStat was monitoring
the activations a 5x5 layer it would generate 25 columns of data. In the
GridLogView these 25 columns could be arranged as in a 5x5 grid in the
same layout as the units in the monitored Layer.  Indeed, a monitored
layer automatically sets its geometry to be used for the default
configuration of the GridLogView.

</P>
<P>
The header label information in the GridLogView is also different in
that is is arranged in the same grid layout as the data and its field
header name labels are selectable and manipulable with the mouse.  This
allows complete interactive configuration of the GridLogView display, as
follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>Move with left-mouse-button (LMB)</B>
<DD>
Clicking and dragging on a header item will move it, in unit-level
chunks, and will then update the display of all the corresponding data
for that column.  Items can be moved anywhere, and overlap is not a
problem (previous versions would crash upon overlap).
<DT><B>Reshape with Shift-LMB or middle-mouse-button</B>
<DD>
For items that are displayed in the header with a grid of boxes (e.g.,
monitored values), you can reshape the grid.  The grid will not shrink
below the number of elements to be displayed, so keep that in mind as
you reshape it.
<DT><B>Edit with right-mouse-button (RMB)</B>
<DD>
Clicking with the right mouse button will pull up the GridLogViewSpec
for that item for more detailed configuration
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_196.html">13.3.5.2  Customizing the GridLogView Display</A>). 
</DL>

<P>
Resizing the GridLogView window changes the number of visible data
lines, always in such a way as to keep the grids roughly square.  So, if
you want to have more items in the display, this can also be achieved by
making the window narrower!
