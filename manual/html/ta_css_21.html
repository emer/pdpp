The primary interface to CSS is via the command shell, which provides a
prompt and allows the user to enter commands, etc.  This shell has some
useful features, including <EM>editing</EM>, <EM>history</EM>, and
<EM>completion</EM>, all of which are provided by the GNU readline
library.

</P>
<P>
The current line can be edited using a subset of the emacs editing
commands, including Ctrl-f, Ctrl-b, Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e, etc.

</P>
<P>
A running history of everything that has been entered is kept, and can
be accessed by using the Ctrl-p and Ctrl-n commands (previous and next,
respectively).  This makes it easy to repeat previous commands,
especially when combined with the editing facility.

</P>
<P>
Completion occurs when the TAB key is pressed after some
partially-entered expression, causing the shell to suggest a completion
to the expression based on the part that has already been entered.  If
there is more than one possible completion, then the shell will beep,
and pressing TAB a second time will produce a list of all of the
possible completions.  Completion is based on all of the keywords
currently defined (including types, commands, functions, user-defined
variables and functions, etc), except in the following two cases: If the
expression starts with a ".", it is interpreted as a path, and the next
segment of the path to either an object or a member function of an
object is suggested by the shell.  If the expression contains a scoping
operator "::", then the completion will interpret whatever is in front
of the scoping operator as a type name, and will suggest the possible
members, subtypes, etc. of that type as completions.
