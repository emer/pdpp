<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
 
Use the 'type' command, such as 'type UnitSpec', which will display a
list of all CSS-accesable type information for that object, including
descriptive comments.  If you just type 'type' with no arguments, then a
list of all defined types is presented.

<DT><B>How do I call the copy operator (=) for a hard-coded objects in CSS?</B>
<DD>
Hard coded types are a little different than types defined within CSS
(e.g., a Unit is a hard-coded type), because they are used to refer to
things like units, layers, etc, in the network, which are external to
css. In particular, they are *always* pointers. There is no such thing
as a 'Unit un' in css -- its always really (implicitly) 'Unit* un'. So,
dereferencing a pointer to a hard-coded object doesn't do anything,
meaning that it can't tell the difference between assigning the pointer
to point to a new object, and copying the object that the pointer
currently points to.  To explicitly invoke the object's copy operator,
use the CopyFrom() member function (e.g., Unit* un = .units[0];
un.CopyFrom(.units[1]); ).  Note that if you obtain a pointer to a
hard-coded object via a "path" in the object hierarchy, then it knows
that this is not just a free css pointer, and it will apply CopyFrom
when you do '='.

<DT><B>How do I deal with errors in Scripts that are auto-running at startup?</B>
<DD>
If you startup the program with the project name on the
command line, then the project will load over and over again if there is
an error with a script that is set to run upon loading the project
(auto-run).  The solution is to load the project from the Root menu, and
to immediately move the mouse over the xterminal window, and type a
Return into that window when the error occurs.  Then, you can debug the
problem with the script at the point where the error occurred.
