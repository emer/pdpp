An environment can be specified where each event has multiple possible
target patterns, each of which has an associated probability of
occurring.  Thus, when an event is presented to the network, one out of a
set of possible target patterns is chosen according to their relative
probabilities.  These probabilistic distributions of target states can
actually be learned in a stochastic constraint satisfaction network.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1405"></A>
Probabilities can be associated with different patterns by creating
<B>ProbPattern</B> objects instead of the usual <B>Pattern</B> ones.  The prob
pattern has a <CODE>prob</CODE> field, which contains its probability of
occurrence.

</P>
<P>
However, in order for these probabilities to be used in the presentation
of patterns, one needs to use a <B>ProbEventSpec</B>, which has special
code that chooses which pattern to present based on its probability.
Not all patterns in an event need to be probabilistic.  Indeed, the
usual setup is to have a deterministic input pattern, and then a set of
possible outputs that follow from this one input.  The determiniation of
which patterns are probabilistic and which are deterministic is made by
putting all of the mutually-exclusive probabilistic alternative patterns
in a <B>ProbPatternSpec_Group</B>. 

</P>
<P>
Thus, one needs to make a sub-group in the <CODE>patterns</CODE> group on the
<B>ProbEventSpec</B>, and this sub-group has to be of type
<B>ProbPatternSpec_Group</B>.  Then, regular <B>PatternSpec</B> objects, one
for each alternative target pattern, should be created in the sub group.
Make sure to set the <CODE>pattern_type</CODE> field of these pattern specs to
be <B>ProbPattern</B>, so that the patterns which are created in the event
will have probabilities associated with them.

</P>
<P>
When events are actually created from a prob event spec, one needs to
edit the patterns within the sub-group and assign each of them
probabilities that sum to 1 for all the patterns in the group.  Thus,
the network will be certain of choosing one of them to present.
