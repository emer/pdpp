<H1><A HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">2  Installation Guide</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter provides a guide to installing the PDP++ software.  There
are two basic forms in which the software is distributed -- the
executable files only for use by an "end user", and the complete source
code, for use by a "programmer" who will be compiling new additions to
PDP++.  We will refer to the executable files only distribution as the
"end user's version", and the source code distribution as the
"programmer's version", where the version refers to the manner in which
the software is distributed, not to the software itself (it's all the
same code).

</P>
<P>
For most systems, the end user's distribution is obtained in two parts,
a tar file containing pre-compiled binaries for a particular system, and
another which contains the manual, demos, default files, and other
miscellaneous things.  This is for the end user who will not need to
compile new versions of the software to add new functionality to it.
The relevant tar files are:
<PRE>  pdp++_version_bin_CPU.tar.gz
  pdp++_version_ext.tar.gz
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>version</VAR> is the version number of the software release, and
<VAR>CPU</VAR> is the cpu-type of the system you will be running on (see
below).

</P>
<P>
For LINUX systems under RedHat or compatible distributions, an rpm
version (with the <TT>`.rpm'</TT> extension) is available.

</P>
<P>
For MS Windows, a standard <CODE>setup</CODE> install file (with the
<TT>`.exe'</TT> extension) is available.

</P>
<P>
For Mac OS-X, a standard "package" file (with the <TT>`.pkg.sit'</TT>
extension) is available.

</P>
<P>
The currently supported <VAR>CPU</VAR> types (listed in rough order of level
of support) are:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>LINUX</CODE>
<DD>
An Intel 386-Pentium machine running a modern glibc version of
Linux (e.g., RedHat 7+).
<DT><CODE>CYGWIN</CODE>
<DD>
An Intel 386-Pentium machine running the Windows operating system (using
the Cygnus CygWin system as a compilation environment).
<DT><CODE>DARWIN</CODE>
<DD>
A Mac running OS-X (aka Darwin), which is based on FreeBSD.  Binaries
are for the power PC (PPC) architecture.
<DT><CODE>SUN4</CODE>
<DD>
A SUN sparc-station system running a modern 5.x Solaris version of the
operating system.
<DT><CODE>SGI</CODE>
<DD>
A Silicon Graphics workstation running a recent Irix 6.x release.
<DT><CODE>HP800</CODE>
<DD>
A Hewlett Packard workstation running HP-UX version 10.x.
<DT><CODE>IBMaix</CODE>
<DD>
An IBM RS/6000 machine running AIX v4.1.4 (4.1.x shouldwork)
</DL>

<P>
If you don't have one of these machines, then you will have to compile
the software from the source code using the programmers distribution.

</P>
<P>
The programmer's distribution is contained in one tar file that contains
the source code along with the manual and other supporting files:
<PRE>  pdp++_version_src.tar.gz
</PRE>

<P>
These and any other files mentioned below can be obtained from our
anonymous FTP servers:

<P>
The Colorado site is updated most frequently.
