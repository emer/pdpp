<H4><A NAME="IDX1154" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">13.3.4.2  The Graph Area</A></H4>

<P>
The Graph Area of the GraphLogView appears as a region consisting of a
field of background color overlaid with a horizontal X axis at the
bottom of the Graph region, one or more vertical Y-axes on the left
edge of the Graph region, lines of data, and optionally text labels
scattered about. The lines of data will not initially be visible until
data is actually recorded in the PDPLog.  If separate graphs are
selected, multiple such graphs may be arranged within the display.

</P>
<P>
The range of the Axes is determined by the GraphLogViewSpec of their
corresponding fields. The tick marks are displayed as decimal numbers
with a factor of 10 multiplier on the bottom of the Y-axes or left side
of the x-axis. (i.e. If the axis tick read "2.15" and the multiplier
is"10X" then the actual value is 21.5).

</P>
<P>
The GraphLogView Graph area can be zoomed and scrolled in a similar way
as the Netview by selecting the <I>Mv/Scan</I> or <I>ReScale</I> mode buttons
in the upper left of the GraphLogView. In Move/Scan mode, the graph's
coordinates can be moved around by pressing and holding a mouse button in
the background of the graph area. Moving with the left mouse button
allows translations in both the Horizontal and Vertical planes, while
the middle mouse button constrains movement to the Horizontal plane only
and similarly the right mouse only allows Vertical movement. Likewise in
Rescale mode, the left mouse button scales both dimensions, the middle
mouse button only scales the Horizontal, and the right mouse button only
scales the Vertical.

</P>
<P>
In Move/Scan mode if the mouse button is pressed while the pointer is
over a line in the graph area the pointer will turn to a clenched hand
and the value of the data at the mouse pointer location will appear
beside the pointer. Dragging the mouse with left mouse button pressed
will move a small box along the selected line, jumping from data point
to data point and indicating the values. When the mouse button is
released, the value and location box remain on the line until the
<CODE>Init</CODE> button is pressed on the GraphLogView, or the log's buffer
is overfilled.
