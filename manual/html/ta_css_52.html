<P>
A subgroup menu appears in the menubar of a WinBase object for each of
the group members of the object. The name of the menu corresponds to the
name of the group member (e.g., The Layer object has a group of units
and a group of projections. It would have two subgroup menus, one
labeled <CODE>.units</CODE> and a second labeled <CODE>.projections</CODE>. The "."
before the name of the subgroup is used to indicate that the subgroups
are sub-objects of the WinBase object. In the CSS script language one
would access objects in these subgroups using the "." operator. (e.g.,
To access the first network in the project one would type
<SAMP>`.projects.networks[0]'</SAMP>). In addition the subgroup menus appear in
a non-italicized font to distinguish them from the "Object" and "Action"
menus of the WinBase. The subgroup menu's have the following menu
choices.  Occasionally subgroup menus may add additional menu choices as
well (e.g., The Processes submenu of the Project has the menu choice
<I>Control Panel</I> which opens a control panel dialog for one of the
processes in the subgroup). Some of the group operations require the use
of a file requester. See section <A HREF="ta_css_61.html">7.19  File Requester</A>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Edit</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX282"></A>
The Edit action brings up a Group Edit Dialog for the group or an Edit
Dialog for an individual object (section <A HREF="ta_css_53.html">7.6  The Edit Dialog</A>).
<DT><CODE>New</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX283"></A>
The New action allows the use to create new objects in the group or in a
subgroup of the group. The user can chose to create objects of the
base object type, objects of a subclass of the base object type, or a
subgroup object. A popup dialog appears which enables the user to select
the number of objects to create, the type of objects, and where to place
them. Sometimes the popup dialog may have additional fields and toggles
which are particular to the item being created. If the auto_edit flag in the
global settings (see section <A HREF="ta_css_57.html">7.17  Settings Affecting GUI Behavior</A>) is turned on, an edit
dialog will be created for the newly created objects when button-1 (left
button) is pressed on the OK button of the popup dialog. If button-2 (middle
button) is pressed the edit dialog will be created only if the auto_edit
variable is off. When button-3 (right button) is pressed an edit dialog will
always be created.
<DT><CODE>Open In</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX284"></A>
The "Open in" action allows the user to open a previously-saved object
file and add the data into the group. See section <A HREF="ta_css_67.html">8.1.3  Saving and Loading Objects</A>.
<DT><CODE>Load Over</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX285"></A>
The "Load Over" action allows the user to open a previously-saved object
file and overwrite the objects in the group with the data in the file. See section <A HREF="ta_css_67.html">8.1.3  Saving and Loading Objects</A>.
<DT><CODE>Save</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX286"></A>
The Save action allows the user to save the group or a group element as
a PDP++ object file using the file requester or the object's most
recently used name for saving. See section <A HREF="ta_css_67.html">8.1.3  Saving and Loading Objects</A>.
<DT><CODE>Save As</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX287"></A>
The Save As action allows the user to save the group or a group element in
a new PDP++ object file using the file requester. See section <A HREF="ta_css_67.html">8.1.3  Saving and Loading Objects</A>.
<DT><CODE>Remove</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>
The Remove action allows the user to remove the group or a group
element. The user is prompted with a confirmation dialog to confirm the
choice. However, If the chosen object is referenced by other objects
then it will not be deleted.
<DT><CODE>Duplicate</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX289"></A>
The Duplicate action allows the user to add a duplicate of one of the
objects in the group to the group or its subgroups.
<DT><CODE>Move Within</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX290"></A>
This allows the user to move objects to new positions within the group
(e.g., for rearranging the order of layers in the network, which is
important for the feedforward Bp algorithm).
<DT><CODE>View Window</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX291"></A>
View Window brings the window associated with selected object to the
front, deiconifies it, or creates it if a window does not exist.
