<H1><A HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">3  Conceptual Overview</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter provides a general introduction to the PDP++ software and
conceptual overview of its major components.  The primary objective here
is to explain the important design decisions that went into the
software, so that you will be able to get the most out of it.  This is
oriented towards those who have some familiarity with neural networks,
and who want to find out how things are done in this software.  However,
it is also useful for all users to be aware of the rationale for the way
things are set up, so that it becomes clearer where to look for ways to
solve problems that might arise, or accomplish various simulation
objectives.
