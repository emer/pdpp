<H3><A NAME="IDX1301" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">14.2.5  RBp Sequence Processes and TimeEvents</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1302"></A>

The <B>RBpSequence</B> process is a special <B>SequenceProcess</B> that knows
how to appropriately treat sequences of events that have time values
associated with them.  The classes <B>TimeEnvironment,
TimeEvent_MGroup</B>, and <B>TimeEvent</B> together define an environment
which consists of sequences (groups) of events where each event is
specified to occur at a particular time.  Furthermore, the environment
defines certain simple forms of interpolation, which allows trajectories
to be formed by specifying crucial points on the trajectory, but not
everything in between.  Also, the <B>RBpSequence</B> process uses the
<CODE>end_time</CODE> of the <B>TimeEvent_MGroup</B> to set the <CODE>time_window</CODE>
of the trial process, so that exactly one backprop phase will happen per
sequence.

</P>
<P>
If a <B>TimeEnvironment</B> is not being used, a <B>RBpSequence</B> will
simply run the sequence of events in each event group, one by one,
through the trial process.  This would make each event in the sequence
appear at tick-wise intervals (i.e., every <CODE>dt</CODE>).  In contrast, the
<B>TimeEnvironment</B> based events have the benefit of making the
environment invariant with respect to changes in <CODE>dt</CODE>, which can be
very useful when <CODE>dt</CODE> is changed during training, etc.

</P>
<P>
A <B>TimeEnvironment</B>, aside from setting the default types of events
and event groups to also be time-based ones, has a default interpolation
parameter:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1306"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Interpolate interpolate</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1307"></A>
The following forms of interpolation are defined:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>PUNCTATE</CODE>
<DD>
Each event appears for the single slice of time that it has
specified.

<DT><CODE>CONSTANT</CODE>
<DD>
Events persist with the same activations from the time on the event
until the next event comes along.

<DT><CODE>LINEAR</CODE>
<DD>
Performs linear interpolation from one event to the next.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
As with all sequence-based environments (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_139.html">11.3  Representing Sequences of Events</A>), a sequence of
events is defined by putting all the events in a subgroup.
<B>TimeEvent</B>s should be put in subgroups of type <B>TimeEvent_MGroup</B>,
which is where the specific form of interpolation to be used for this
particular sequence, and the total duration of the sequence, are
specified:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1308"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Interpolate interpolate</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1309"></A>
This is just like the interpolation variable on the environment, except
it includes the <CODE>USE_ENVIRO</CODE> option, which uses whatever is set on
the environment object.  Thus, one can have different sequences use
different kinds of interpolation, or they can defer to the environment.
<DT><CODE>float end_time</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1310"></A>
The total duration of the sequence.  It is automatically set to
be as long as the latest event in the group, but you can set it to be
longer to cause a <CODE>CONSTANT</CODE> interpolation to hold onto the event
until <CODE>end_time</CODE> has been reached.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1312"></A>
The time event object is just like a regular event except that it adds a
time field, which specifies when this event is to first be presented to
the network.  How long it is presented depends on the interpolation
scheme and how soon another event follows it.
