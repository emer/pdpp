<P>
Before you actually run the project, we'll mention a couple of final
things you will want to do.

</P>
<P>
You can watch the state of the network in the <B>NetView</B> while it
learns and during testing.  The NetView is automatically updated by the
Trial processes in both the training and testing process hierarchies.
(You can have it updated by other processes by selecting <I>View:Object</I>
/ <I>Add Updater</I> / <I>&#60;process&#62;</I> in the NetView, or by clicking on a
process and a network in the project view, and hitting <I>Add Updater</I>).
Both of these Trial processes will send the <B>NetView</B> an update
signal, so you can see the values of whatever state variable you'd like
to look at updated after each trial of training or testing.  You might
select <CODE>act</CODE> as the variable to display in the NetView, toggle
<CODE>Auto Range</CODE> off, and set the <CODE>max</CODE> and <CODE>min</CODE> on the
color scale to 1 and -1.  That way the meanings of the color in the
color scale stay fixed as the various patterns are presented.

</P>
<P>
If you are recording the project using a script, you might want to turn
off the scripting process at this point, since the network creation
process is complete.  De-iconify the script and click <I>StopRec</I>.  You
may <I>Edit</I> your script (which should pull up an editor and allow you
to view the script file), to see what steps were taken, etc.

</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether you recorded a script, you will want to save the
state of the project as it is now, so that it can simply be re-loaded
from a project file, just like the XOR example.  Select <I>Object</I> /
<I>Save As</I> in the <I>Project</I> window, and specify a file name for
saving (a ".proj.gz" will automatically be added to the end of the file
name). 

</P>
