<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.2.6  Processes</A></H3>

<P>
Since everything has been properly initialized, and the various displays
are all laid out for our use, we are ready to try to teach the network
the XOR function.  We train networks, and test them, by running
<B>Process</B> objects that operate on them.

</P>
<P>
<B>Process</B> objects are described at length in section <A HREF="pdp-user_148.html">12  Processes and Statistics</A>.  We will only
say enough about them here to give you a general sense of what they are
and what they do.  You can think of processes as objects that consist of
several parts: an initialization part, a loop part, and a finishing-up
part.  When a process is run, it first carries out its initialization
process; then it loops for a specified number of iterations or until
some performance criterion is met, and then it finishes up and exits.
For many processes, the loop consists of simply calling the process's
sub-process over and over again.  At the bottom of the process tree, we
call routines that actually interact with the network.  Processes also
spawn sub-processes that calculate statistics, such as the sum of
squares statistic that measures how well the network has solved the
learning problem that has been posed to it.  Some statistics, called
<CODE>loop_stats</CODE>, are calculated at the end of each step in the process
loop; others are calculated only when finishing up.

</P>
<P>
In the case of backpropagation, we have a three-level process hierarchy.
At the bottom of the hierarchy is the <B>TrialProcess</B>.  This process
takes an event, consisting of an input pattern and a target pattern,
from the <B>Environment</B>, and then carries out the three phase process
described previously (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_15.html">4.1  Backpropagation and XOR</A>).  The processing is actually
implemented by looping through the <B>Layer</B>s in ascending numerical
order; then looping, within each layer, through the <B>Unit</B>s, and
calling functions associated with each unit to compute the quantities as
previously described.  All of the variables mentioned there are
explicitly stored in each unit, and can be inspected once they have been
computed by selecting the appropriate button in the <B>NetView</B>.  At the
end of the trial, the sum of squares statistic is calculated; in this
case it isn't much of a sum since there is just one output unit.

</P>
<P>
The Trial process is actually called as a sub-process of the
<B>EpochProcess</B>.  All the Epoch process does is loop through the set of
pattern pairs in the <B>Environment</B>, calling the trial process to
process each pattern pair.  Before it starts, it initializes its
statistic, the sum of the trial-wise sum-squared-error
(<CODE>sum_sum_SE_Stat</CODE>), to 0. As it loops, it computes the
<CODE>sum_sum_SE_Stat</CODE> by aggregating the <CODE>sum_SE_Stat</CODE> statistic
over each of the training trails, so that at the end of the epoch, it
reflects the sum over all of the trials in the epoch.  At the end of the
epoch, it passes the <CODE>sum_sum_SE_Stat</CODE> up to the training process.

</P>
<P>
The Epoch process is called by the <B>TrainProcess</B>.  This process
initializes the epoch counter before it starts.  It stops when the
counter reaches a specified maximum value, or when the latest (or last)
sum-squared-error value (<CODE>lst_sum_SE_Stat</CODE>) falls below its
stopping criterion.  The stopping criterion is actually a property of
the Train process's <B>SE_Stat</B> statistic, <CODE>lst_sum_SE_Stat</CODE>.  This
statistic simply copies the last <CODE>sum_sum_SE_Stat</CODE> from the epoch
process, and compares it to the criterion, passing a special return
value to the Train process when the criterion is met.  If so, the
process exits from the loop at that point, and training is stopped.
