An object has both fields with data and functions (aka methods) which it
can perform.  A PDP Unit as an object might have the fields
<CODE>activation</CODE> and <CODE>netinput</CODE>, and some functions like
<CODE>ComputeActivation()</CODE> and <CODE>ClearNetInput()</CODE>. In C++ this might
look like:

</P>
<PRE>class Unit {
  float         activation;     // this is a member holding activation
  float         netinput;       // this is a member holding net input

  virtual void  ComputeActivation(); // this is a function 
  void          ClearNetInput();        // this is a function 
}
</PRE>

<P>
C++ also provides the mechanisms for object inheritance in which a new
object can be defined as having the same fields and functions as its
"parent" object with the addition of a few fields and/or functions of
its own. In PDP++ the <B>BpUnit</B> object class inherits from the parent
<B>Unit</B> class and adds fields such as <CODE>bias weight</CODE> and a BackProp
version of <CODE>ComputeActivation</CODE>. In C++ this might look like:

</P>
<PRE>class BpUnit : public Unit {
  float         biasweight;     // a new member in addition to others

  void          ComputeActivation(); // redefining this function
  void          ClearBiasWeight();  // adding a new function
}
</PRE>

By <I>overloading</I> the ComputeActivation function the BpUnit redefines the
way in which the activation is computed. Since it doesn't overload the
ClearNetInput function, the BPUnit clears its net input in the exact
same way as the standard unit would. The new function ClearBiasWeight
exists only on the BpUnit and is not available on the base Unit
class. Through this type of class inheritance, PDP++ provides a
hierarchical class structure for its objects.
