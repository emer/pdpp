<H3><A NAME="IDX242" HREF="ta_css_toc.html">6.4.1  Naming Conventions</A></H3>

<P>
The basic tension in naming something is the length vs. descriptiveness
tradeoff.  In general, we try to avoid abbreviations, but really long
words like "environment" inevitably get shortened to "Env", etc.

</P>
<P>
The bulk of the conventions we have established have to do with
distinguishing between different categories of names: class type names,
member function names, and member names being the major categories.  In
addition, the way in which names composed of multiple words are formed
is discussed.

</P>

<H2>6.5  Object Class Names</H2>

<P>
Class types are first-letter-capitalized with words separated by
capitalization: e.g. <CODE>MyClass</CODE>.  There are certain exceptions, where
an underbar '_' is used to attach a high-frequency suffix, usually from
a template, to the name:

</P>
<P>
Common Suffixes:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>_List</CODE>
<DD>
taList derivative.
<DT><CODE>_Group</CODE>
<DD>
taGroup derivative.
<DT><CODE>_MGroup</CODE>
<DD>
MenuGroup derivative.
<DT><CODE>_Array</CODE>
<DD>
taArray derivative.
<DT><CODE>_SPtr</CODE>
<DD>
Smart Spec object pointer (PDP++).
</DL>

<P>
Also if the class name contains multiple words, words which are actually
acronyms ending with a capital letter are separated from the following
word by an '_', e.g., (CE_Stat).

</P>
<P>
Classes in lower-level libraries also have the name-space identifier
prefixed to the name, which is lower case: e.g., <CODE>ta</CODE>, <CODE>taiv</CODE>,
<CODE>css</CODE>.

</P>

<H2>6.6  Enums</H2>

<P>
<CODE>enum</CODE> type names follow the same naming convention as class types.
<CODE>enum</CODE> members are all upper-case, words are separated by '_',
e.g., <CODE>INIT_STATE</CODE>.

</P>

<H2>6.7  Member Names</H2>

<P>
Members are lower-case, words are separated by a '_', e.g., member_name.
One exception is for names ending in spec or specs in which case there
is no separation (e.g., viewspecs).

</P>

<H2>6.8  Method Names</H2>

<P>
Methods are first-letter-capitalized, words are separated by
capitalization (e.g., <CODE>RunThis()</CODE>).  However, there some special
prefixes and suffixes that are exceptions to this rule, because they are
"high frequency" and denote a whole class of methods:

</P>
<P>
Prefixes:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Dump_</CODE>
<DD>
Saving and loading functions.
<DT><CODE>Compute_</CODE>
<DD>
Network computation functions (PDP++).
<DT><CODE>Send_</CODE>
<DD>
Network communication functions (PDP++).
<DT><CODE>C_</CODE>
<DD>
C code versions of process functions (PDP++).
<DT><CODE>Init_</CODE>
<DD>
Special initialize function for processes (PDP++).
</DL>

<P>
Suffixes:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>_impl</CODE>
<DD>
Implementation (guts) of some other function which is the one that
should be called by the user.
<DT><CODE>_xxxx</CODE>
<DD>
Other _impl type functions that do specific aspects of the
implementation (xxx is lower case).  Examples in PDP++ include _flag,
_force.
<DT><CODE>_</CODE>
<DD>
(just a trailing underbar) This is a short version of _impl, which is
used extensively in InterViews, and sparingly in TA/PDP++.
<DT><CODE>_post</CODE>
<DD>
A function which is to be called after another one of the same name (for
two-step processes).
<DT><CODE>_Copy</CODE>
<DD>
A function called after the Copy function (e.g., to clean up pointers).
<DT><CODE>_gui</CODE>
<DD>
A special GUI version of function call.
<DT><CODE>_mc</CODE>
<DD>
A special menu callback version of function call.
