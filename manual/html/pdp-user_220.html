The <B>CsUnit</B> is fairly simple.  As was described for backpropagation
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_201.html">14.1.3  Bp Unit Specifications</A>) the bias weight is implemented as a connection object
on the unit.  It also keeps a record of the minus and plus phase
activation values, <CODE>act_m</CODE> and <CODE>act_p</CODE> (primarily for display
purposes), and the change in activation state for this unit, <CODE>da</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
All of the different flavors of constraint satisfaction algorithms
differ only in their activation function.  Thus, each one has a
different type of unit spec.  However, they all derive from a common
<B>CsUnitSpec</B>, which has parameters shared by all the different
algorithms.  This unit spec has the parameters for noise and gain, the
step size taken in updating activations, and schedules for adapting
noise and gain over time:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CsConSpec_SPtr bias_spec</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1350"></A>
Points the the connection spec that controls the learning of the
bias weight on the unit.
<DT><CODE>MinMaxRange real_range</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1351"></A>
The actual range to allow units to be in. Typically, units are
kept within some tolerance of the absolute <CODE>act_range</CODE> values, in
order to prevent saturation of the computation of inverse-sigmoid
functions and other problems.
<DT><CODE>Random noise</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1352"></A>
These are the parameters of the noise to be added to the unit.
<CODE>GAUSSIAN</CODE> noise with zero mean is the standard form of noise to
use.  Noise is always added to the activations in an amount proportional
to the square-root of the step size (except in the BoltzUnitSpec, where
no noise is added).
<DT><CODE>float step</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1353"></A>
The step size to take in updating activation values.  A smaller
step leads to smoother updating, but longer settling times.
<DT><CODE>float gain</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1354"></A>
The sharpness of the sigmoidal activation function, or 1 over
the temperature for the Boltzmann units.  A higher gain makes the units
act more like binary units, while a lower gain makes them act more
continuous and graded.
<DT><CODE>ClampType clamp_type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1355"></A>
This controls the way in which external inputs (from the environment)
are applied to the network.  <CODE>HARD_CLAMP</CODE> means that the activation
is exactly the <CODE>ext</CODE> value from the environment.
<CODE>HARD_FAST_CLAMP</CODE> is like hard clamp, but optimized so that all of
the inputs from clamped layers are computed once at the start of
settling, saving considerable computational overhead.  This should not
be used if the inputs are noisy, since this noise will not be included!
<CODE>SOFT_CLAMP</CODE> means that external inputs are added into the net
input to a unit, instead of forcing the activation value to take on the
external value.  <CODE>SOFT_THEN_HARD_CLAMP</CODE> performs soft clamping in
the minus phase, and then hard clamping in the plus phase.
<DT><CODE>float clamp_gain</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1356"></A>
When soft clamping, this parameter determines how strongly the external
input contributes to the unit net input.  It simply multiplies the value
in the <CODE>ext</CODE> field.
<DT><CODE>Random initial_act</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1357"></A>
Controls the random initialization of unit activations in the
<CODE>InitState</CODE> function.
<DT><CODE>bool use_annealing</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1358"></A>
Controls whether an annealing schedule is used to adapt the
variance of the noise distribution over time (<CODE>noise_sched</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>Schedule noise_sched</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1359"></A>
This schedule contains values which are multiplied times the <CODE>var</CODE>
parameter of the <CODE>noise</CODE> field to get an effective variance level.
The value from the schedule is the linear interpolation of the
<CODE>cycle</CODE> count from the settle process based on points listed in the
schedule.  Thus, each point in the schedule gives a variance multiplier
for a particular cycle count, and intermediate cycles yield interpolated
multiplier values.
<DT><CODE>bool use_sharp</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1360"></A>
Controls whether a sharpening schedule is used to adapt the
gain parameter over time (<CODE>gain_sched</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>Schedule gain_sched</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1361"></A>
This is a schedule for the gain multiplier.  The effective gain is the
<CODE>gain</CODE> parameter times the value from this schedule.  The schedule
works just like the <CODE>noise_sched</CODE> described above.
</DL>

<P>
The basic <B>CsUnitSpec</B> uses the inverse-logistic activation function
developed by <CITE>Movellan and McClelland, 1994</CITE>.  Thus, the change in
activation is a function of the difference between the actual net input,
and the inverse logistic of the current activation value.  This
formulation ends up being an exact solution to the objective function
used in their derivation.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1362"></A>
The <B>SigmoidUnitSpec</B> uses a simple sigmoidal function of the net
input, which is like the formulation of <CITE>Hopfield, 1984</CITE>, and is
also the same as the RBp units described in section <A HREF="pdp-user_210.html">14.2.3  RBp Unit Specifications</A>.  This type
also has the option with the <CODE>time_avg</CODE> parameter of computing time
averaging (i.e., as a function of the <CODE>step</CODE> parameter) on either
the <CODE>ACTIVATION</CODE> or the <CODE>NET_INPUT</CODE>, as was the case with the
RBp implementation.  As was described there the <CODE>NET_INPUT</CODE> option
allows units to settle faster.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1363"></A>
The <B>BoltzUnitSpec</B> implements a binary activation function like that
used Boltzmann machine and the network of <CITE>Hopfield, 1982</CITE>.  Here,
the unit takes on a 0 or 1 value probabilistically as a sigmoidal
function of the net input.  The gain of this sigmoid can also be
represented by its inverse, which is known as temperature, by analogy
with similar systems in statistical physics.  Thus, we have a
<CODE>temp</CODE> parameter which is used to update the gain parameter. Noise
is intrinsic to this function, and is not added in any other way.

<A NAME="IDX1367"></A>
The <B>IACUnitSpec</B> implements the interactive activation and
competition function.  This requires two new parameters, <CODE>rest</CODE> and
<CODE>decay</CODE>.  If the net input to the unit is positive, the activation
is increased by <CODE>net * (max - act)</CODE>, and if it is negative it is
decreased by <CODE>net * (act - min)</CODE>.  In either case, the activation
is also decayed towards the resting value by subtracting off a
<CODE>decay * (act - rest)</CODE> term.  IAC also has the option of only
sending activation to other units when it is over some threshold
(<CODE>send_thresh</CODE>).  Doing this requires a different way of computing
the net input to units, so it must be selected with the
<CODE>use_send_thresh</CODE> flag, and by setting the <CODE>update_mode</CODE> in
the <B>CsCycle</B> process to <CODE>SYNC_SENDER_BASED</CODE>.  Pressing
<I>ReInit</I> or <I>NewInit</I> at any level of process including and above
the <B>CsTrial</B> process will check for the consistency of these
settings, and prompt to change them.

</P>
<P>
The <B>LinearCsUnitSpec</B> computes activation as a simple linear function
of the net input.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1368"></A>
The <B>ThreshLinCsUnitSpec</B> computes activation as a threshold-linear
function of the net input, where net input below threshold gives an
activity of 0, and (net - threshold) above that.
