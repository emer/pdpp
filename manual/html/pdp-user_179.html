The <B>CyclesToSettle</B> statistics simply records the number of cycles it
took to settle.  It should be placed in the <CODE>loop_stats</CODE> of the
trial process, where it will be able to grab the final counter value
from the settle process.  This is useful to record how fast a network is
settling, which is often used as a proxy for reaction times, etc.  See
also the <B>ActThreshRTStat</B> section <A HREF="pdp-user_177.html">12.8.6  Reaction-time Based on Crossing an Activation Threshold</A>.

The <B>ScriptStat</B> is a statistic that is meant to be used with a CSS
script.  It provides a generic group of <CODE>vals</CODE> into which the
results of the statistic can be put, and an array of <CODE>s_args</CODE> for
passing arguments to the script to control its behavior.  A very simple
example script code for computing the difference between two unit
activations is as follows:

</P>
<PRE>// this is a sample script stat script

void DoStat() {
  if(vals.size != 1) {  // first, create vals to hold results
    // anything in vals is automatically logged, etc.
    vals.EnforceSize(1);  // do whatever is necessary to get 1 val
    vals[0].name = "act_diff";  // this is the header for the stat val
  }
  // get the first unit (note that we can access 'network'
  // and other member variables from the ScriptStat the script is in)
  Unit* un1 = network.layers[1].units[0];
  // and then the second unit
  Unit* un2 = network.layers[1].units[1];

  // compute value to put in statistic
  float diff = un1-&#62;act - un2-&#62;act;

  // then store result in the val.  note you can have as many
  // vals as you want and compute as many things as you want!
  vals[0].val = diff;
}

// you *must* call the function so that when the script is run
// the above function is actually run!
DoStat();

The <B>CopyToEnvStat</B> takes data from another statistic and copies it
into a data environment (just a basic environment that holds data for
later analysis).  This is a key piece of a chain of steps involved in
analyzing network representations, etc.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_41.html">5.1  Questions about Processes</A> for an
overview of how this analysis process works, and section <A HREF="pdp-user_145.html">11.9  Environment Analysis Functions</A> for
the types of analyses that can be performed.  The
<CODE>DispDataEnvProc</CODE> can automate the performance and display of
these analysis routines (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_166.html">12.6.5  Miscellaneous other Process Types</A>).

The key parameters on this stat are the <CODE>stat</CODE>, which points to
the statistic to get data from, the <CODE>data_env</CODE>, which points to
the environment to save the data in, and the <CODE>accum_scope</CODE>, which
determines how much data to accumulate in the data env (e.g., EPOCH
accumulates over an entire epoch, etc).

The <B>ProjectionStat</B> projects data from another statistic (e.g., a
<CODE>MonitorStat</CODE>) onto a stored vector (<CODE>prjn_vector</CODE>), and
records the resulting scalar value in <CODE>prjn</CODE>.  A projection is
just computing the distance between two vectors, and the various
parameters on this stat determine the type of distance computation to
perform.  This is useful for analyzing network representations as they
are generated based on for example a principal components analysis
performed on another batch of previously-generated network
activations.  To facilitate this, the buttons <CODE>VecFmPCA</CODE> and
<CODE>VecFmEvent</CODE> provide a way to load the prjn vector from either a
PCA (principal components analysis) performed on a data environment
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_145.html">11.9  Environment Analysis Functions</A>) or just from a stored event pattern (e.g., the
environment can be used to draw a pattern to compare).
