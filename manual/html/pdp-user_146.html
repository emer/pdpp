In the basic model of the environment, all events are equally likely to
be presented to the network.  However, this is often not the case in the
real world.  Thus, PDP++ provides a set of environmental types that
implement frequency-based presentation of events.  These are the
<B>FreqEvent</B>, the <B>FreqEvent_MGroup</B>, and the <B>FreqEnv</B> types.  As
discussed above (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_139.html">11.3  Representing Sequences of Events</A>, section <A HREF="pdp-user_136.html">11.1  Environments</A>), processes can ask the
Environment for a single Event or a Group of Events. The FreqEvent is an
individual event with its own frequency, and the FreqEvent_MGroup is a
group of events with an associated frequency.

The frequency model supported by these types has a number between zero
and 1 associated with each event or event group.  This <CODE>frequency</CODE>
value is essentially a probability with which the event should be
presented.

<A NAME="IDX869"></A>
A <B>FreqEnv</B> environment type must be used in order for the frequency
variable associated with events or groups to be used.  This type of
environment uses the <CODE>InitEvents</CODE> function to create the list of
events or groups that will be presented for the current epoch.  There
are two modes of selecting these events according to their frequency.
Setting <CODE>sample_type</CODE> to <CODE>RANDOM</CODE> results in a random sample
of events to be presented for each epoch, with the probability of an
event's inclusion proportional to its frequency value.  The
<CODE>PERMUTED</CODE> option instead adds a fixed number of a given event
which is equal to the frequency of that event times the <CODE>n_sample</CODE>
parameter.

</P>
<P>
The <B>FreqEnv</B> class also has the following variables which affect this
sampling process:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>int n_sample;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX870"></A>
The number of samples of the Events or EventGroups to make per epoch.
In the <CODE>RANDOM</CODE> case, this is the number of times to "roll the
dice" to determine if a given event gets into the epoch.  An event or
group with a frequency of 1 will appear exactly <CODE>n_sample</CODE> times in
a given epoch.  Events with lower frequency will occur less often and
with lower probability.  In the <CODE>PERMUTED</CODE> case, this number is
multiplied times the frequency to determine how many copies of an event
or group appear in a given epoch.
<DT><CODE>FreqLevel freq_level</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX871"></A>
Has the values <CODE>NO_FREQ</CODE>, <CODE>EVENT</CODE>, or <CODE>GROUP</CODE>. It
controls the level at which the frequency sampling occurs.  If
<CODE>NO_FREQ</CODE> is selected, frequency is ignored and the environment is
just like the basic one. The other two options should be selected
depending on the type of process that is being used--use <CODE>GROUP</CODE>
for sequence-based processes (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_139.html">11.3  Representing Sequences of Events</A>), and otherwise use
<CODE>EVENT</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
Note that there is also a <B>FreqTimeEvent</B>, <B>FreqTimeEvent_MGroup</B>,
and <B>FreqTimeEnv</B>, which are frequency versions of the time-based
environments described below.
