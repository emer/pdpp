<H3><A NAME="IDX703" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">10.5.1  Implementational Details About Connections</A></H3>

<P>
The is a general policy regarding the organization of functions and
parameters for connections, connection groups, and connection
specifications:

</P>
<P>
Only those functions that relate to the computational processing done by
the connections should be defined in the connection spec, while the
"structural" or other "administrative" functions should be defined in
the connection group object so that the spec can be invariant with
respect to these kinds of differences.  The idea is that the spec
defines <EM>functional</EM> aspects while the object defines various
implementational aspects of an object's function (i.e. how the
connections are arranged, etc..).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX704"></A>
<A NAME="IDX705"></A>
Thus, the <B>Con_Group</B> type has a large number of functions that are
useful for making, finding, and removing connections.  See the header
file <TT>`src/pdp/netstru.h'</TT> for a listing of these.  The Con_Group has
a special way of representing connectivity.  The group itself contains
<B>Connection</B> objects, which define the state variables associated with
the connection itself.  However, the pointer to the unit on the other
side of the connection (the sending unit in the case of receiving
connections, and the receiving unit in the case of sending connections),
is kept in a separate list, which is in one-to-one correspondence with
the connection objects.  This arrangement allows for the same connection
state variables to be shared across connections between different units.
Indeed, the sending and receiving connection groups from the same
projection share a single connection object between them.  Some of the
projection types (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_121.html">10.3.3.2  Tesselated (Repeated) Patterns of Connectivity</A>, section <A HREF="pdp-user_124.html">10.3.3.5  Miscellaneous other Projection Types</A>) define
additional forms of connection sharing.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX706"></A>
Note that only one side of the connection is actually saved when a
network is saved.  This is the receiving side by default.  Thus, after
loading a project in from disk, the projection which manages the
connections has to perform a <CODE>ReConnect_Load</CODE> function which builds
the sending connections that correspond to the receiving connections
that were just loaded in.  A similar kind of operation must take place
after copying a network.

</P>
<P>
For the functions that are defined in the <B>ConSpec</B>, a convention has
been established regarding the division of labor between iterating
through the connections in a group, and processing a given connection.
Thus, there are two versions of each function defined in the con spec,
one to apply to a single connection and another to apply to an entire
Con_Group.  The one which applies to a single connection has the name
<CODE>C_XXX</CODE> where <CODE>XXX</CODE> is the name of the Con_Group version.
Since some implementations of algorithms use bias weights, which are
represented by a connection without a surrounding connection group, it
is sometimes necessary to define a bias-weight version of a
connection-specific function.  Such a function will have the name
<CODE>B_XXX</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the <CODE>C_</CODE> version of the function is <EM>not</EM> declared
<CODE>virtual</CODE>, while the <B>Con_Group</B> is.  This was done for reasons
of speed, since the <CODE>C_</CODE> versions can be inlined within the
iteration defined in the con-group version.  However, it means that if
you change one of the <CODE>C_</CODE> functions, <EM>you must redefined the
associated con-group version!</EM>

</P>
<P>
Also note that the same object type, a <B>Con_Group</B> (and its associated
<B>ConSpec</B>), is used for both sending and receiving connections.  Thus,
the <B>ConSpec</B> will have functions that apply to both cases.

</P>
<P>
As with the unit specs, a standard way of breaking up neural
computations has been established by defining some basic functions on
the con spec.  Only the Con_Group version of these functions are listed
below, but a C_ version is also defined.  Also note that the C_ versions
of these functions typically take a connection pointer, receiving unit,
and sending unit arguments.  The functions are as follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>InitWtState(Con_Group* cg, Unit* ru)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX707"></A>
Initialize state variables (i.e. at beginning of training).
<DT><CODE>InitWtDelta(Con_Group* cg, Unit* ru)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX708"></A>
Initialize variables that change every delta-weight computation.  This
clears any existing weight change computations.
<DT><CODE>float Compute_Net(Con_Group* cn, Unit* ru)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX709"></A>
Computes the net input from the connections in this group, assuming that
they are receiving connections.
<DT><CODE>Send_Net(Con_Group* cg, Unit* su)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX710"></A>
Adds the net input contribution from the given sending unit to all of
the receiving units on the other side of these connections.  This
assumes that the con group is a sending connection group of unit
<CODE>su</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>float Compute_Dist(Con_Group* cg, Unit* ru)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX711"></A>
Returns the distance (squared difference) between the unit activations
and connection weights for all connections in group.  This assumes it is
a receiving group.
<DT><CODE>Compute_dWt(Con_Group* cg, Unit* ru)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX712"></A>
Computes the delta-weight change for all connections in the group.  This
is typically called on the receiving connections, and is defined by
specific algorithms.
<DT><CODE>UpdateWeights(Con_Group* cg, Unit* ru)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX713"></A>
Updates the weights of the all the connections in the group. This again
is defined by specific algorithms, but is called by generic functions up
the network hierarchy.
