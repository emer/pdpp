<P>
The PDPLog structure has many options for viewing its data. Each of
these options is represented by a corresponding LogView object. Like
the network object, PDPLogs can have multiple views.

</P>
<P>
Each of the views has its own methods of interacting with the data,
however all the views have some properties in common. All the views are
window's into the data stored in the log's datatable <CODE>data</CODE>. While
some of the views may show only a portion of the datatable at a time,
the maximum amount of data they can show is limited by the size of the
datatable itself, <CODE>data_bufsz</CODE>. The <CODE>log_file</CODE> however records
all the information sent to log sequentially. Each of the LogViews
provides four buttons which shift the the view's window on the
datatable. If the view's window on the datatable moves outside the range
of the datatable, the datatable is scrolled by moving log's
<CODE>data_range</CODE> throughout the <CODE>log_file</CODE>.
