<P>
In this phase, a measure of the error or mismatch between the target and
the actual output is computed, and the negative of the derivative of the
error with respect to the activation and with respect to the net input
to each unit is computed, starting at the output layer and passing
successively back through successively lower numbers of layers.  By
default the error measure used is the summed square error:

</P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_17.html_sub_1.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="	ss = SUM_i (t_i - a_i)^2
">
<P>
where the index i runs over all of the output units.  The derivative
of this with respect to the activation of each output unit is easily
computed.  We actually use the negative of this derivative, which we
call <I>dE/da_i</I>.  For output units, this quantity is

</P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_17.html_sub_2.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="dE/da_i = (t_i - a_i)
">
<P>
We then compute a quantity proportional to the negative derivative of
the error measure with respect to the net input to each unit, which is

</P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_17.html_sub_3.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="dE/dnet_i = dE/da_i f'(net_i)
">
<P>
where <I>f'(net_i)</I> is the slope of the activation function given the net
input to the unit.

</P>
<P>
This quantity is then propagated back to successively lower numbered
layers, using the formulas

</P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_17.html_sub_4.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="dE/da_j = SUM_i w_ij dE/dnet_i
"><P>
and
<P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_17.html_sub_5.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="dE/dnet_j = dE/da_j f'(net_j)
">
</P>

<P>
Here subscript <I>i</I> indexes units that receive connections from unit <I>j</I>;
we can see these formulas as providing for the backward propagation of
error derivative information via the same connections that carry
activation forward during the activation phase.
