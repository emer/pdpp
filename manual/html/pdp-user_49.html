In all WinBase windows, there is a horizontal menubar along the top. In
this menubar is a "Object" menu (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_51.html">6.3  The "Object" Menu</A>), and also
"Subgroup" menus (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_53.html">6.5  The SubGroup Menu(s)</A>) for access to the sub-objects in
this class.

</P>
<P>
To access the menus press and hold button-1 (left button) on the mouse
while the mouse pointer is over the menu name. A smaller vertical menu
window will pop up under the mouse pointer. Moving the mouse vertically
while the button is still pressed will highlight the different choices
in a the menu. Some of the items in the menu may have three dots
<SAMP>`...'</SAMP> after them. When highlighting these menu items a cascaded
menu will popup to the right of the selected menu item. The cascaded
submenu may be traversed by moving the mouse pointer horizontally into
the submenu, and then moving the mouse vertically as before. Again,
button-1 must be pressed and held down during this operation. To select
an item, release the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the
highlighted selection. To cancel the menu (to select nothing) move the
mouse out of the menu and release the mouse button. Menu items which
spawn submenus may not be selected. A menu may be pinned (it will stay
on the screen after the mouse is released) by releasing the mouse while
the pointer is on the menu name or on a submenu's name. A selection can
be made from a pinned window by clicking (pressing and then releasing a
button) on the desired selection. This will also cause the pinned menu
to become unpinned and it will disappear.

<B>Note:</B> This applies specifically to the motif mode in
InterViews. Open-look or other modes may be slightly different.
