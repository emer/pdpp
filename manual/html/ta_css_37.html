<P>
If you add an extra "#" to the beginning of the comment directive, it
will automatically be inherited by any sub-classes of the given object.
Otherwise, it only applies to the object on which it was given.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>#IGNORE</CODE>
<DD>
Do not register this object in the list of types.
<DT><CODE>#NO_TOKENS</CODE>
<DD>
Do not keep a record of the tokens of this object type.  Types can keep
pointers to all instances or tokens of themselves.  This can be
expensive in terms of memory, but the interface uses "token menus" for
arguements or methods which are pointers to objects of the given type.
<DT><CODE>#NO_INSTANCE</CODE>
<DD>
Do not create a global instance (<CODE>TAI_xxx</CODE>) of this object.  This
will prevent tokens of this object from being made.
<DT><CODE>#INSTANCE</CODE>
<DD>
If default is not to create instances, then create one anyway for this
object.
<DT><CODE>#NO_MEMBERS</CODE>
<DD>
Do not store the members (including member functions) of this class.
Only the type name will be registered.
<DT><CODE>#NO_CSS</CODE>
<DD>
Do not create CSS stub functions for the member functions on this object.
<DT><CODE>#INLINE</CODE>
<DD>
Causes this item to be edited in a single line in a dialog box (e.g. for
geometry x,y,z) and affects saving/loading, etc.
<DT><CODE>#EDIT_INLINE</CODE>
<DD>
Only causes this item to be edited in a single line in a dialog box, but
in all other respects it is treated as a normal included class.  This is
useful for certain complex objects such as arrays and lists that do not
otherwise save/load well as INLINES.
<DT><CODE>#BUTROWS_x</CODE>
<DD>
Set the number of button rows to be x, useful if default allocation of 
number of rows of buttons for edit dialog is not correct
<DT><CODE>#EXT_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
Sets the default extension for saving/loading this type to xxx.
<DT><CODE>#COMPRESS</CODE>
<DD>
store dump file's of this object compressed.  Since the save files are
text, they can be large, so it is a good idea to auto-compress dump
files for large objects.
<DT><CODE>#MEMB_IN_GPMENU</CODE>
<DD>
This indicates that there is a group object as a member of this one
who's objects should appear in menus where this object appears.
<DT><CODE>#VIRT_BASE</CODE>
<DD>
This is a "virtual" base class: don't show in token menus for this
object, etc.
<DT><CODE>#NO_UPDATE_AFTER</CODE>
<DD>
Don't call UpdateAfterEdit when loading this object (and other places it
might automatically get called).  Since a list of objects which should
be updated after loading is made, small or numerous objects should not
be added to this list if not necessary.
<DT><CODE>#IMMEDIATE_UPDATE</CODE>
<DD>
Perform an immediate UpdateAfterEdit on this object after loading (i.e.,
it creates other objects..).  Normally, updating happens after all of
the other objects have been loaded.
<DT><CODE>#SCOPE_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
Type of object to use as a scope for this object.  The scope restricts
token menus and other things to only those things that share a common
parent token of the given scope type.
<DT><CODE>#ARRAY_ALLOC</CODE>
<DD>
Specific to taList_impl derivatives: this list or group should have
saved items created all together during loading (ie., like an array).
If actually using array-based memory allocation, this is essential, but
otherwise it can only speed things up a little bit.
<DT><CODE>#LINK_SAVE</CODE>
<DD>
Save the actual contents of this object even when it appears as a link
in a list.  Usually just the link pointer is saved, and the object is
saved later in the group that actually owns it. This overrides this and
saves the information in both places -- can be useful if info from the
linked object is needed during loading.
<DT><CODE>#NO_OK</CODE>
<DD>
Do not present an OK button on the edit dialog for this object.
<DT><CODE>#NO_CANCEL</CODE>
<DD>
Do not present a CANCEL button on the edit dialog for this object.
