<H2><A NAME="IDX510" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">9.3  Startup Arguments to PDP++</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX511"></A>
<A NAME="IDX512"></A>

PDP++ interprets a large number of startup arguments.  It looks for any
of the arguments that can be passed to CSS (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_78.html">7.4.3  CSS Startup options</A>), which
includes a script file that can be used to automate a set of actions to
be taken in the simulator.  This is particularly useful for running
simulations in the background.  The file <TT>`css/include/startup.css'</TT>
provides an example of a startup file that loads in a saved project,
sets some log files to record, and then runs the training or batch
process.  After the process is completed, the program will quit (unless
the CSS argument -i was given).

</P>
<P>
The following arguments are PDP++ specific:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-nogui</CODE>
<DD>
This specifies that the graphical user interface (GUI) should not be
started (only the CSS interface will be present).
<DT><CODE>-p &#60;project_file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
This specifies a project file to be loaded upon startup.  Note that any
argument within the first two args containing ".proj" will be
interpreted as a startup project to run.  Thus, one can type <CODE>bp++
xor.proj.gz</CODE>, and it will automatically load the project.
<DT><CODE>-d &#60;default_file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
This specifies that the given default file should be used.  If this
parameter is not given, then a default file based on the name of the
executable (e.g., bp.def for bp++) will be used.  One can also write a
<TT>`.pdpinitrc'</TT> file containing CSS code that sets the default file
with the following kind of statement: <CODE>root-&#62;default_file =
"default_file"</CODE>.  This can be based on the executable name by examining
<CODE>argv[0]</CODE>, which contains the name of the executable being run.
</DL>

<P>
In addition to the CSS arguments, PDP++ interprets all of the arguments
for controlling the InterViews graphical user interface.  These
arguments allow one to select a different "look and feel" from the
default one, which is an enhanced version of the Motif style:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-openlook</CODE>
<DD>
The Sun OpenLook look.
<DT><CODE>-motif</CODE>
<DD>
A standard Motif look.  Note that the default is an enhanced SGI
version of Motif, not this one.
<DT><CODE>-monochrome</CODE>
<DD>
A Motif-like monochrome mode.  It is the default if you have a
monochrome monitor.
</DL>

<P>
If you are logging in remotely or are somehow restricted to a non
XWindows environment, you have to use the <CODE>-nogui</CODE> argument.  This
turns off the graphical user interface completely, and leaves you with
the CSS interface.

</P>
<P>
Note that when you run simulations in the background, you will want to
use <CODE>-nogui</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Finally, there are some other InterViews arguments that might be useful:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-nodbuf</CODE>
<DD>
This turns off double-buffering, which is on by default and results in
smoother, flicker-free window updating, but also consumes much more
display RAM from your XWindows server.  Users of XTerminals in
particular might want to use this option.
<A NAME="IDX513"></A>
<DT><CODE>-visual &#60;dpy type&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
By using this option and passing your default visual class (use
<CODE>xdpyinfo</CODE> to obtain the visual class(es) supported by your x
display) (e.g., PseudoColor for standard 8 bit (256 color) X displays),
you can obtain a private color map for the PDP++ session.  This can be
useful if you are running out of colors in your shared colormap (e.g.,
because Netscape is such a color hog!).
