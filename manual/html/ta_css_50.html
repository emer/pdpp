The "Object" menu always appears as the left most menu in a WinBase's
menubar.  The "Object" menu for each object is used to perform file
based actions on the object itself. Many of these actions involve the
use of a file requester dialog. See section <A HREF="ta_css_61.html">7.19  File Requester</A>.  These
actions on the object can also be called through css (e.g., the Print
action can be called from css as <SAMP>`object.Print()'</SAMP>).  The "Object"
menu has the following menu actions:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Load</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX262"></A>
Load a text object dump of an object of the same class as this object on
top of this object, replacing the values of fields of this object with
the values of the saved object's fields. The saved object file is
selected with the file requester.
<DT><CODE>Save</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX263"></A>
Save a text object dump of this object in a file created with the file
requester, or with the object's most recently used filename for saving.
<DT><CODE>SaveAs</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX264"></A>
Save a text object dump of this object in a -new- file
created with the file requester.
<DT><CODE>Edit</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX265"></A>
The Edit menu action brings up an Edit Dialog on the object.
See section <A HREF="ta_css_53.html">7.6  The Edit Dialog</A>.
<DT><CODE>Close</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX266"></A>
The Close menu action will attempt to close/delete the object.
If the object is referenced or pointed to by other objects, then
it will not actually be deleted, only the windows which display
it will be removed. The user must confirm the deletion if it
is possible to safely delete the object. <B>NOTE THAT CLOSE IS NOT
ICONIFY!, it really does delete the object, not just close the menu.</B>
<DT><CODE>Copy From</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX267"></A>
Copies from another object of the same or related type -- replace all
of the current data in the object with those in another.  In the menu,
only the same or subtypes of this object will be shown, but in the
script, any type of related object can be passed to this function.
<DT><CODE>Copy To</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX268"></A>
Copies the data in this object to another object.  This can be useful
if you want to copy from a more basic type of object (e.g., Environment)
to a derived type (e.g., FreqEnv) -- CopyFrom won't show the more basic
type of object to copy from, but CopyTo will show the derived type.
<DT><CODE>DuplicateMe</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX269"></A>
Makes another copy of this object -- creates a new object and then
copies from this current object to that new object.  Note this is
DuplicateMe in the script code.
<DT><CODE>ChangeMyType</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX270"></A>
Changes the type of this object to be another related type (e.g., change
to a FreqEnv from an Environment).  Will usually do a good job of
updating the various links to this object if changed.  Not good for
objects within a network, or generally for Stat objects that are
aggregated.  This is ChangeMyType in the script code.
<DT><CODE>SelectForEdit</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX271"></A>
Allows you to select a field (member) of this object to be edited in a
<B>SelectEdit</B> object, which consolidates parameters and functions
across multiple objects into a single edit dialog
(@xref{proj-seledit}).
<DT><CODE>SelectFunForEdit</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX272"></A>
Allows you to select a function (method) of this object to be
accessible from a <B>SelectEdit</B> object, which consolidates parameters
and functions across multiple objects into a single edit dialog
(@xref{proj-seledit}).
<DT><CODE>Help</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX273"></A>
Will automatically pull up a help browser for information relevant to
this object.  Depends on the browser actually running on your system, as
specified in the Settings on the root object.
<DT><CODE>Print</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX274"></A>
The Print menu action will save a snapshot of the entire object's window
to a file in Postscript format using a file requester.  Note that this
printout file uses structured graphics so it will scale well if resized,
etc.
<DT><CODE>Print Data</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX275"></A>
The Print data menu action will save a snapshot of the window's data,
not including the menubars and window decoration, to a file in
Postscript format using a file requester.
<DT><CODE>Update Menus</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX276"></A>
If objects are created or deleted, sometimes the menus of their parent
objects can become out of date. If this appears to be the case then
use the "update menus" menu action on the parent object to fix the menus.
The "update menus" menu action recursively traverses the menus of the
object and its subobjects, adding and deleting menu items appropriately.
<DT><CODE>Iconify</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX277"></A>
This will iconify the window (shrink down to an iconic representation,
to get it out of your way).
