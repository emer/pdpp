<H2><A NAME="IDX513" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">9.4  Signals to Control a PDP++ Process</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX514"></A>
<A NAME="IDX515"></A>

</P>
<P>
When a PDP++ process is running in the background (see previous section
for instructions on how to do this), it is no longer possible to gain
control of it through either the script or graphical interface.
However, the process will respond to a number of signals which allow
one to save the state of the process to a file.  The saved file can then
be pulled up in the interface and the state of the simulation examined.

</P>
<P>
Signals can be sent to a process using the unix <CODE>kill</CODE> command,
with two arguments: the signal type and the process id.  There are two
signal types that are "user defined", <CODE>USR1</CODE> and <CODE>USR2</CODE>.  We
have defined <CODE>USR1</CODE> to save any networks in the process to file(s)
named <TT>`PDP++NetSave.#.net.gz'</TT>, and <CODE>USR2</CODE> to save any projects
to file(s) named <TT>`PDP++Project.#.proj.gz'</TT>.  The <CODE>ALRM</CODE> (alarm)
signal will also save project files.

</P>
<P>
Any of the "lethal" signals like <CODE>SEGV</CODE> and <CODE>BUS</CODE> which cause
the process to crash result in an attempt to save the current state of
any open projects in <CODE>PDP++Recover.#.proj.gz</CODE> files.  Thus, the
user will not typically lose any work even when (or if) the software
crashes.  Note that the number # of the saved file will increment to be
unique in the directory.

</P>
<P>
To kill a process without getting one of these recover files, use the
strongest kill signal, <CODE>KILL</CODE> (signal number 9), which will bypass
the saving of a recover file.

</P>
