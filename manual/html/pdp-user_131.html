<B> Figure: </B> The NetView Member Region
<P>

<P>
Below the Action region, in the lower left corner of the NetView is the
Member Region. This region contains a vertical scrollbox of buttons
which are labeled with the names of the member fields of the units and
their connections in the NetView. If there are more member field buttons
than can fit in the Member Region, the vertical scrollbar on the left of
the Member Region will allow the user to scroll through all the desired
member fields.

</P>
<P>
By pressing one of the member buttons, the View Region will update to
reflect the values of that member on the units it is associated with. In
the case of connection member buttons, the user will need to pick a unit
from which the connections are to be viewed. In this case, the View Mode
action button in the Action Region will be automatically selected so
that the user may pick a target unit. When The View Mode action button
is selected the cursor will change to a pointing hand with which the
user can pick units in the View Region. If the user chooses a unit
member button instead of a connection member button, the display will
revert to the default "Select" mode, and the "Select" Action button in
the Action Region will be selected. In the "Select" mode, the pointer
is usually an arrowhead.

</P>
<P>
By using the middle mouse button the user may select multiple member
values to be displayed. When more than one member value is selected, the
selected member buttons are numbered in the order of selection. The
units in the "View Region" will split in to multiple sections each
representing one of the selected member values. The units may split
horizontally or vertically depending upon the setting of the
<CODE>unit_layout</CODE> member of the NetView.

</P>
<P>
Selecting a member button with the right mouse button will provide a
more detailed description of member variable.
