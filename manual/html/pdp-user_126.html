<H3><A NAME="IDX680" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">10.4.1  Implementational Details About Units</A></H3>

<P>
The base <B>UnitSpec</B> defines a standardized way of splitting up the
computations that take place on a unit.  This allows there to be a
single function at the level of the <B>Network</B> which iterates through
all of the layers and they iterate through all of their units and call
these functions.  This makes writing process code easier, and provides a
conceptual skeleton on which to implement different algorithms.  Note
that the unit has simple "stub" versions of these functions which simply
call the corresponding one on the spec.  This also simplifies
programming.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>InitState(Unit* u)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX681"></A>
Initializes the unit's state variables, including activations, net
input, etc.
<DT><CODE>InitWtDelta(Unit* u)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX682"></A>
Initializes the stored connection weight changes (i.e., changes that
have not yet been applied to the weights).
<DT><CODE>InitWtState(Unit* u)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX683"></A>
Initializes the connection weight values for all of the receiving
connections of the unit.
<DT><CODE>Compute_Net(Unit* u)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX684"></A>
Iterates over the receiving connections of the unit and sets the
unit's <CODE>net</CODE> field to the summed product of the sending unit's
activation value times the weight.
<DT><CODE>Send_Net(Unit* u)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX685"></A>
Iterates over the <EM>sending</EM> connections of the unit and
increments the <CODE>net</CODE> field of the unit's it sends to.  This way of
computing net input is useful when not all units send activation (i.e.,
if there is a threshold for sending activation or "firing").  A given
algorithm will either use <CODE>Compute_Net</CODE> or <CODE>Send_Net</CODE>, but not
both.
<DT><CODE>Compute_Act(Unit* u)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX686"></A>
Turns the net input value into an activation value, typically by
applying a sigmoidal activation function, but this varies depending on
the particular algorithm used.  The version in the base <B>UnitSpec</B>
just copies the net input into the activation (i.e., it is linear).
<DT><CODE>Compute_dWt(Unit* u)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX687"></A>
Iterates over the receiving connections on the unit and
calls the <CODE>Compute_dWt</CODE> function on them, which should compute the
amount that the weights should be changed based on the current state of
the network, and a learning rule which translates this into weight
changes.  It should always add an increment the current weight change
value, so that learning can occur either pattern-by-pattern ("online"
mode) or over multiple patterns ("batch" mode).
<DT><CODE>UpdateWeights(Unit* u)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX688"></A>
Actually updates the weights by adding the changes
computed by <CODE>Compute_dWt</CODE> to the weights, applying learning rates,
etc.  This function should always reset the weight change variable after
it updates the weights, so that <CODE>Compute_dWt</CODE> can always increment
weight changes.  Note that this function is called by the
<B>EpochProcess</B>, which decides whether to perform online or batch-mode
learning (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_156.html">12.4.3  Iterating over Trials: EpochProcess</A>).
