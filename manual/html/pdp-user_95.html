<H3><A NAME="IDX441" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">8.2.4  Group Edit Dialog</A></H3>

<P>
The group edit dialog (GED) is in many ways like the the Edit dialog for
other objects (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_54.html">6.6  The Edit Dialog</A>). In the GED however, all the elements
of the group are editable at one time. The elements are represented in a
horizontal scrollbox. If there are more elements than can be represented
in the dialog, dragging the scrollbar under the scrollbox will allow
access to the other members. The members are ordered sequentially from
left to right.

</P>
<P>
In some cases the elements of the groups may be of different types. When
this occurs, all the members of all the element types are listed in the
member names section of the dialog. Elements which do not contain a
certain member in the member names section will have a blank field where
the edit field of that member would normally appear. The dialog buttons
(Ok, Apply, Revert, Cancel) apply to all the elements of the group.

</P>
<P>
In addition to the standard editing control keys in the Edit Dialog, the
following keys are are mapped to special functions.

</P>

<IL>
<LI>Meta-f moves the Ibeam forward to the same field in the next group

member 
<LI>Meta-b moves the Ibeam backward to the same field in the previous

group member 
</IL>

<P>
Many of the functions described in the previous section
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_94.html">8.2.3  Group Functions</A>) are available in the menus of the group
edit dialog.  Note that if you want to operate on the subgroups (e.g.,
to move them around), you can do EditSubGps which will pull up a dialog
of these subgroups where the move and other actions apply to them.

</P>
