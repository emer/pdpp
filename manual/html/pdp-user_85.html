Because they use the standard C++ syntax, CSS script files can be
compiled into "hard" code that runs (fast) as a stand-alone application.
Of course, the files must not use any of the CSS shortcuts, and must
otherwise be standard C++ code (i.e., no executable code outside of
functions, using the correct <CODE>.</CODE> or <CODE>-&#62;</CODE> operator, etc).

</P>
<P>
There are three main steps that are needed to compile your CSS code.
The first, which need only be done once, is the creation of the
appropriate libraries that will be linked with the C++ compiled code to
produce an executable.  The second is formatting your file so that it
can be both run by CSS and compiled by C++.  The third is creating a
Makefile which will allow C++ to compile your file.  An example of this
is provided in the directory <TT>`demo/css'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
There are two special libraries that are linked into your C++
executable, one in the <TT>`src/ta'</TT> directory, and one in the
<TT>`src/css'</TT> directory.  Both can be made using top-level Makefile
commands, or by going into the directories separately.  <SAMP>`make
LibMin'</SAMP> makes a library which contains the minimal type-access stuff
from the <TT>`src/ta'</TT> directory of the distribution, and it makes the
<TT>`libtypea_min'</TT> library.  <SAMP>`make hard_css'</SAMP> makes a library of
special functions in <TT>`src/css'</TT> (e.g., the "special math" functions
which have been added into CSS and are not part of the standard C
library, and the Dir and ReadLine functions).  This library is
<TT>`libhard_css'</TT>.  Both of these libraries will be visible to the C++
compiler using the makefiles as described below.

</P>
<P>
The CSS file needs to have a couple of conditially-included elements
that resolve the basic differences between CSS and C++.  Basically, this
amounts to including a header file that estabilshes some defines and
includes some commonly-used standard library headers, which are
automatically present in CSS.  This is the <TT>`css/hard_of_css.h'</TT>
file.  It is only included when compiling by making it conditional on
the pre-processor define <CODE>__CSS__</CODE>, which is automatically defined
by CSS.  Also, <TT>`hard_of_css.h'</TT> defines a <CODE>main</CODE> function which
calls a function called <CODE>s_main</CODE>, which is the actual main function
that should be defined in your script.

</P>
<P>
The following example illustrates these elements, and can be used as a
template for making your own CSS files compilable (see <TT>`demo/css'</TT>
for a larger example):

</P>
<PRE>#ifndef __CSS__
#include &#60;css/hard_of_css.h&#62;
#endif

void s_main(int ac, String* av) {
  // do stuff here..
}

// in css, call our main function as the thing we actually run..
#ifdef __CSS__
s_main(argc, argv);
#endif
</PRE>

<P>
In order to make the C++ compiling environment as similar to CSS as
possible, a variant of the same Makefile can be used.  This assumes that
the makefiles for your CPU type are correct (i.e., those used in
installing the PDP++/CSS source-code distribution (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_2.html">2  Installation Guide</A>,
section <A HREF="pdp-user_4.html">2.7  Installing the Programmers Version</A>)).  The following steps will result in a Makefile that
will enable you to compile your CSS code.

</P>
<P>
1) Copy the sample makefile in <TT>`config/Makefile.hard_of_css'</TT> into
the directory where your CSS file is to be compiled, and name it
<TT>`Makefile.in'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
2) Edit this file and ensure that the PDPDIR path is pointing to the
installed pdp++ distribution.

</P>
<P>
3) Then, do a <CODE>make -f Makefile.in InitMakefile</CODE>, which will make a
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> in the current directory that can be used to compile
your file.

</P>
<P>
4) To compile, just type <CODE>make &#60;filenm&#62;</CODE>, where <CODE>&#60;filenm&#62;</CODE> is
the CSS file without any extension (i.e., the name of the executable
that will be produced.  Some C++ compilers will complain if the file
does not end in a "standard" C++ extension like .cc or .C, so you may
have to rename it or create a symbolic link from your .css file (CSS
does not care about using a non .css extension, as long as you specify
the entire file name).
