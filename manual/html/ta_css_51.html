<P>
Some objects will have an "Actions" menu following their "Object" menu.
In the Action menu are functions which are apply specifically to the
object and are not the common file based functions found on the Object
menu. If you wish to perform a function directly on the object you
are viewing in the window, the "Actions" menu is a good place to look.
For more specific information concerning an object's "Action" menu
please refer to the section of this manual which pertains to the
object itself.
