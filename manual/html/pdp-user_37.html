<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.3.5  Creating Logs For Viewing Data</A></H3>

<P>
Before you run the network, you need to create logs of the results of
training and testing and views that allow you to examine the contents of
these logs.  We'll create a Log with a <B>GraphLogView</B> to follow the
<B>SE_Stat</B> over epochs and Log with a <B>GridLogView</B> to follow the
activations of the output units at test.

</P>
<P>
To create the <B>GraphLogView</B>, select <I>.logs</I> / <I>New</I> /
<I>GraphLog</I>, and hit <I>Ok</I> in the New dialog.  It will automatically
prompt you for which process you want to update this view, which should
be <I>Epoch_0</I>.  This will cause the <B>GraphLogView</B> to get information
from this process about what is being monitored there: the <B>SE_Stat</B>,
summed across output units and across patterns in the epoch.  By default
the epoch number will be used at the X axis, so this GraphLogView is now
ready.

</P>
<P>
To create the <B>GridLogView</B>, select <I>.logs</I> / <I>New</I> / <I>GridLog</I>,
and specify that <I>Trial_1</I> should update this log.  Again, the header
for the data that are being monitored is automatically retrieved.

</P>
<P>
As an advanced example of setting up a grid log, we now describe how you
may be able to set up a special GridLog associated with your Test process
(Epoch_1) that displays the weights in your network at the end of each
test that you run.  This may or may not be something you really need to
do depending on your goals.  But the example shows some advanced
features that are useful and powerful, so we go through it to expose you
to them.

</P>
<P>
1a. Create a monitor stat for each projection.  Make sure <I>r.wt</I> is the
current variable displayed, and that you are in <CODE>Select</CODE> mode
instead of <CODE>View</CODE> mode. Now select the projection in the netview
which connects the hidden and output layers. Then click <I>Monitor
Values</I> / <I>new</I>.  For <I>In Process</I>, select <I>EpochProcess</I> /
<I>Epoch_1</I>, and for <I>Loop/Final</I> select <I>FINAL</I>, then <I>OK</I>. We
selected <I>Final</I> here since we want to log the values of the weight at
the end of each epoch.

</P>
<P>
1b. Repeat step 1 selecting the input-&#62;hidden layer projection instead.

</P>
<P>
2. Create a new GridLog with <I>.logs</I> / <I>New</I> / <I>GridLog</I>, then
<I>OK</I> the popup, and select <I>Epoch_1</I> as the updater for this log.

</P>
<P>
3. Now comes the interesting part.  We're going to re-arrange this
display so it displays the weights in a way that better reflects the
network's structure.  To do this we are going to change the geometry and
layout of the weight matrices for each projection.  In the GridLog there
is a "header" at the top associated with each column in the log (the
sum-squared error, the EpochCounterStat (labeled <I>epoch</I>) and each of
the two projections you are monitoring, each labeled <I>wt</I>).  We can
manipulate these headers with the mouse to rearrange their layout.

</P>
<P>
3a. Use the middle button (or shift plus left button) to reshape the
layout.  We first want to reshape the hidden-to-output weights to be 2
units wide by 4 units tall, so that each row of units will be the
weights from one of the four output units.  Move the mouse to the right
hand side of the first <I>wt</I> grid, and middle-click and hold it down
while dragging upwards and to the left into a shape that is 4 tall and 2
wide -- it will not let you configure a shape that doesn't hold all 8
of the weight values, so you need to keep that in mind as you configure.
It may take a few tries to get this right.

</P>
<P>
3b. Next we want to reshape the input-to-hidden weights to be 4 units
wide by 2 tall, so that gain one row represents the weights for one
receiving unit.   Do this using the right mouse button.  You can also
use the left mouse button to move the columns around, and if you want to
relabel the columns, that can be done by right-mouse-button clicking on
the headers.

</P>
<P>
4. Then, press <I>Run</I> in the test epoch process control panel to see
the weights!  To verify the weigh values and understand how they
correspond to those in the NetView, click on <I>r.wt</I> in the NetView,
(make sure you are in <I>View</I> mode), and select the first hidden unit.
The weights from the input units should be the same as those in the
GridLog for the first row of the bottom set of weights.  Similarly, the
second hidden unit's weights are those in the second row of the bottom
set of weights.  The next set of weights are best viewed using <I>s.wt</I>
to look at the <EM>sending</EM> weights from the hidden units to the
output units.  The sending weights for the first hidden unit are shown
in the top row of the top set of weights in the GridLog.  Those for the
second hidden unit are in the second row.  This will all be much clearer
in a fully trained network!
