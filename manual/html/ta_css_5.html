<H2><A HREF="ta_css_toc.html">4.7  Installing the Programmers Version</A></H2>

<P>
Read over the instructions for installing the end-user's version first.
This assumes that you have unloaded the <TT>`pdp++_version_src.tar.gz'</TT>
file in something like <TT>`/usr/local/pdp++'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
IMPORTANT: Whenever you are compiling, you need to have the
environmental variable <CODE>CPU</CODE> set to reflect your machine type (see
above).  Other machine types can be found in the interviews
<TT>`config/InterViews/arch.def'</TT> directory.  These are (in addition to
the above): <CODE>VAX, MIPSEL, SUN3, SUNi386, SUN, HP300, HP200, HP500,
HP, ATT, APOLLO, SONY68, SONYmips, SONY, PEGASUS, M4330, MACII, CRAY,
STELLAR, IBMi386, IBMrt, IBMr2, LUNA68, LUNA88, MIPSEB, MOTOROLA, X386,
DGUX, CONVEX, stratus, ALPHA</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The C++ compiler types that are supported are modern gnu g++/egcs
compilers (anything released after 1999 seems to work), and proprietary
system compilers, which we refer to as  <TT>`CC'</TT> compilers.

</P>
<P>
There are a couple of other libraries that the PDP++ software depends
on.  These need to be made before PDP++ itself can be compiled.  Please
ensure that all of the following are installed properly:

</P>
<P>
1) The <TT>`readline'</TT> library, which will have already been installed
if <TT>`gdb'</TT> or perhaps other gnu programs have been installed on your
system (or if you are using Linux).  Look for
<TT>`/usr/lib/libreadline.so'</TT> or <TT>`/usr/local/lib/libreadline.so'</TT>.
If it isn't there, then download a version of it from one of the gnu ftp
server sites (e.g., <TT>`gnudist.gnu.org'</TT>), and compile and install the
library.

</P>
<P>
2) If using g++, and not on a Linux-based system, you need to make the
the <TT>`libstdc++'</TT> library in the libg++ distribution.  <B>NOTE:</B>
PDP++ now requires the <CODE>sstream</CODE> header file, which defines the
<CODE>stringstream</CODE> class, which is a much improved replacement for
the <CODE>strstream</CODE> class.  <B>For g++ version 2.9x, this header file
might be missing or broken (e.g., under RedHat 7.3, it is present but
broken!).</B>  A good version of this file is present in
<CODE>PDPDIR/include/new_sstream_for_gcc_2.9x.h</CODE>, and should be installed
in the appropriate location (e.g., for RH 7.3, do the following as root:
<CODE>cp include/new_sstream_for_gcc_2.9x.h /usr/include/g++-3/sstream</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<I>I haven't done this install in a while so the following is likely
out of date:</I>. It seems that in the latest distribution of libg++ both
of these are installed in <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT> automatically, but if
they are not there, <TT>`libiostream.so'</TT> is made in the <TT>`libio'</TT>
directory in the libg++ distribution (do a <CODE>make install</CODE> to get
the properly installed or copy it yourself), and <TT>`libstdc++.so'</TT>
is made in the <TT>`libstdc++.so'</TT> directory.  CC/cfront users should
have their iostream code linked in automatically via the standard C++
library that comes with the compiler.

</P>
<P>
3) Install the InterViews library, which provides the graphics toolkit
used by PDP++.  We have collaborated with Michael Hines, developer of
the Neuron simulation system, in developing an improved version of the
InterViews library -- <B>You must install the Hines version of
InterViews!</B>.  The source code for this version is:

</P>
<PRE>iv-15.tar.tz
</PRE>

<P>
available on our ftp servers, and the latest version should be
available from Michael Hines' ftp site at:
<TT>`ftp://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/unix/'</TT>.  Some miscellaneous
information about interviews can be found in the
<TT>`PDPDIR/lib/interviews'</TT> directory.

</P>
<P>
An alternative to compiling interviews yourself is to download
pre-compiled interviews libraries from us.  These are available for
the dominant form of compiler (CC or g++) for the platforms on which
the binary distribution is available (see list above in section <A HREF="ta_css_3.html">4  Installation Guide</A>)
and are provided as <TT>`pdp++_version_ivlib_CPU_CC.tar.gz'</TT> for the
CC compiler and <TT>`..._g++.tar.gz'</TT> for g++.  The include files,
which are necessary to use the libraries to compile PDP++, are in
<TT>`pdp++_version_ivinc.tar.gz'</TT>.  These create a directory called
<TT>`interviews'</TT> when extracted, which means this should be done in
the <TT>`/usr/local'</TT> directory so that the interviews directory is
<TT>`/usr/local/interviews'</TT>.  Alternatively, these can be installed
elsewhere and the <CODE>IDIRS_EXTRA</CODE> and <CODE>LDIRS_EXTRA</CODE> makefile
variables set to point to this directory (see below).  We install ours
in <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT> -- follow the directions in the End Users's
install version described above to do this.

</P>
<P>
4) Once you have the above libraries installed, the next step is to
configure the makefiles for the type of compiler and system you have.
These makefiles are located in <TT>`PDPDIR/config'</TT>.  The actual
makefiles in a given directory (e.g., <TT>`src/bp/Makefile'</TT> and
<TT>`src/bp/CPU/Makefile'</TT>) are made by combining several makefile
components.  <TT>`config/Makefile.std'</TT> has the standard rules for
making various things, <TT>`config/Makefile.defs'</TT> has the standard
definitions for everything, and then <TT>`config/Makefile.CPU'</TT>
overrides any of these definitions that need to be set differently for a
different CPU type (i.e., "local" definitions).  There are several
sub-steps to this process as labeled with letters below:

</P>
<P>
a) If you have installed the software in a location other than
<TT>`/usr/local/pdp++'</TT>: You need to change the definition of
<CODE>PDPDIR</CODE> in <B>both</B> the top-level Makefile
(<TT>`PDPDIR/Makefile'</TT>) and in the definitions makefile
<TT>`PDPDIR/config/Makefile.defs'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
There are makefiles in <TT>`PDPDIR/config'</TT> for the supported CPU types
listed above, and the two different supported compilers (g++, CC). The
makefiles are named <TT>`Makefile.CPU.cmplr'</TT>, where cmplr is either
<TT>`g++'</TT> or <TT>`CC'</TT>. The actual makefile used during compiling for a
given machine is the one called <TT>`Makefile.CPU'</TT>, where CPU is the
type of system you are compiling on (e.g., LINUX, SUN4, HP800, SGI,
etc.).  If you are compiling on a machine for which a standard makefile
does not exist, copy one from a supported machine for the same type of
compiler.  Also, see the notes below about porting to a new type of
machine.

</P>
<P>
b) Copy the appropriate <TT>`Makefile.CPU.cmplr'</TT> makefile (where cmplr
is either g++ or CC depending on which compiler you are using), to
<TT>`Makefile.CPU'</TT> (again, CPU is your machine type, not 'CPU'). For
some architectures there is just one <TT>`Makefile.CPU'</TT> since only
one type of compilier is currently supported. In this case you can
just leave it as is.

</P>
<P>
c) You should put any specific "local" definitions or modifications to
the makefiles in the <TT>`config/Makefile.CPU'</TT>.  This will be included
last in the actual makefiles, and any definitions appearing here will
override the standard definitions.  To see the various definitions that
might affect compiling, look at <TT>`Makefile.defs'</TT>, which contains all
the "standard" definitions, along with descriptive comments.  The
following are items that you will typically have to pay attention to:

</P>
<P>
i) <CODE>IOS_INCLUDES</CODE> and <CODE>IOS_LIB</CODE>: In order to be able to access
via the CSS script language the functions associated with the standard
C++ iostream classes, the type-scanning program <TT>`maketa'</TT> needs to
process the iostream header files: <TT>`streambuf.h'</TT>,
<TT>`iostream.h'</TT>, <TT>`fstream.h'</TT>, and <TT>`strstream.h'</TT>.  These
files are scanned in the <TT>`src/ta'</TT> directory, as part of the
building of the type access library <TT>`libtypea.a'</TT>.  These header
files are different depending on the compiler being used.  For CC
compilers, the <CODE>IOS_INCLUDES</CODE> variable should be set to
<CODE>CC-3.1</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
These header files are typically located in <TT>`/usr/include/CC'</TT>,
which is where the <CODE>CC-3.1</CODE> versions of these files in
<TT>`src/ta'</TT> point to via symbolic links.  Thus, if your headers are
located elsewhere, you will need to change these symbolic links, or
just copy the header files directly into the <TT>`ios-CC-3.1'</TT>
subdirectory in <TT>`src/ta'</TT>.  For g++ users, <CODE>IOS_INCLUDES</CODE>
variable should be set to <CODE>g++-2.8.1</CODE> (for g++ 2.9x) or
<CODE>g++-3.1</CODE> (for g++ 3.x).  As of version 3.0, these g++ iostream
headers are never actually included in the compile process itself, and
are only scanned via the maketa program.  Therefore, they have been
dramatically edited to expose only the relevant interface components.
As such g++-3.1 should work for all subsequent releases of g++
(hopefully!).

</P>
<P>
Note that you can use the <CODE>make force_ta</CODE> action to force a re-scan
of the header files.  A <CODE>make opt_lib</CODE> is then neccessary to compile
this type information into the library.  Finally, the <CODE>IOS_LIB</CODE>
variable should be blank by default for both g++ and C++ users (for
newer g++), but for older g++ configurations it was necessary to set it
to <CODE>-liostream</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
ii) <CODE>IDIRS_EXTRA</CODE> and <CODE>LDIRS_EXTRA</CODE> can be used to specify
locations for other include and library files, respectively (for
example, the cfront compiler may need to be told to look in
-I/usr/include/CC for include files).  Use these if you have installed
any libraries (e.g., InterViews) in a non-standard location.

</P>
<P>
iii) <CODE>MAKETA_FLAGS</CODE> should be set to <CODE>-hx -css -instances</CODE>
by default, but it is also often necessary to include the include path
for the iostream and other C++ library files.  For example, the LINUX
makefile has the following: <CODE>LIBG++_INCLUDE_DIR =
-I/usr/include/linux -I/usr/include/g++-3</CODE>, and then
<CODE>MAKETA_FLAGS = -hx -css -instances $(LIBG++_INCLUDE_DIR)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
iv) <CODE>cppC</CODE>: this is the c-pre-processor, needed for the
<TT>`maketa'</TT> program to process header files.  Although the system
default preprocessor, usually installed in <TT>`/usr/lib/cpp'</TT>, should
work, <TT>`maketa'</TT> was developed around the gnu cpp program, and so
if you run into difficulties using the system cpp, install the gnu one
(included as part of the gcc compiler).  Note that <CODE>make install</CODE>
of gcc/g++ does not apparently install this program by default, so you
have to manually copy it from either your gcc compile directory or
<TT>`/usr/lib/gcc-lib/&#60;machine&#62;/cpp'</TT>.  You often need to include a
define for the system architecture (e.g., <CODE>-D__i386__</CODE> for Linux
on intel chips, or <CODE>-Dsparc</CODE> for suns) in the cppC command.

</P>
<P>
v) <CODE>VT_xxx</CODE> and <CODE>TI_xxx</CODE>: these specify the virtual-table
instantiation and template-instantiation (respectively) files, which
are needed by different compilers.  CC typically requires the VT_xxx
files along with the +e[01] flags to only make one copy of virtual
tables, while g++ requires the TI_xxx files to only make one copy of
the templates.  The TI_xxx files are included by default, so you will
need to define them to be empty to override this default: <CODE>TI_INST_SRC = </CODE>,
<CODE>TI_INST_OBJ = </CODE>, <CODE>TI_INST_DEP = </CODE>.

</P>
<P>
vi) Porting to a non-supported machine: There are a small set of
system-dependent definitions contained in <TT>`src/ta/ta_stdef.h'</TT>,
which are triggered by defines set up in the makefiles.
<CODE>NO_BUILTIN_BOOL</CODE> should be defined if the c++ compiler does not
have a bulitin <CODE>bool</CODE> type, which is the case with most
cfront-based CC compilers, but not g++.  <CODE>CONST_48_ARGS</CODE> determines
if the <CODE>seed48</CODE> and <CODE>lcong48</CODE> functions take const arguments
or not.  In addition, different platforms may require different defines
than those that are flagged in <TT>`ta_stdef.h'</TT>.  In this case, you
will have to edit <TT>`ta_stdef.h'</TT> directly.  Please send any such
additions, and the corresponding <TT>`config/Makefile.CPU'</TT> along with
any notes to us (<TT>`pdpadmin@crab.psy.cmu.edu'</TT>) so we can put them on
our web page for others to use, and incorporate them into subsequent
releases.

</P>
<P>
vii) For some more information about the makefiles, see section <A HREF="ta_css_29.html">6.1  Makefiles and Directory Organization</A>.

</P>
<P>
5) The standard makefiles use gnu's <TT>`bison'</TT> instead of <TT>`yacc'</TT>
for making parsers.  If you don't touch any of the .y files in the
distribution, you won't need either.  If you plan on messing around with
the guts of the maketa type scanner or CSS, then you will probably want
to install the latest version of <TT>`bison'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
6) The dependency information, which is essential if you are going to be
editing the main body of PDP++ code, but not necessary for a one-pass
make of the system, is not made by the default <CODE>make world</CODE> action.
If you want to make this dependency information, do it with a <CODE>make
depend</CODE> after a successful <CODE>make world</CODE>.  Also, note that the
automatic dependencies are made by calling <TT>`gcc'</TT> in the standard
configuration.  If your local C compiler supports the <CODE>-M</CODE> flag for
generating dependency information, then this can be used instead.  Just
change the definition for <CODE>CC</CODE> in your <TT>`Makefile.CPU'</TT>.  If you
don't have gcc and your local C compiler doesn't support this, you can
edit the end of the <TT>`Makefile.std'</TT> and change it to use the
<TT>`makedepend'</TT> program, which we have not found to work as well, but
it is an option.

</P>
<P>
7) On some systems, the standard <TT>`make'</TT> program is broken and will
not work with our complex makfile system.  This is true of the SUN4
system and IBMaix, and may be true of others.  In this case, you will
have to install the GNU make program, and use it to compile the
software.  If you get inexplicable errors about not being able to make
certain things (seems to be the .d dependency files in particular that
cause a problem), then try using GNU make (again, available at
<TT>`gnudist.gnu.org'</TT> or mirrors).

</P>
<P>
8) If your CPU supports shared libraries (most do now), you will need to
insure that the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environment variable includes the
path <CODE>PDPDIR/lib/CPU</CODE> nad <CODE>PDPDIR/interviews/LIB/CPU</CODE> where
PDPDIR is the location of the pdp++ distribution, and CPU is your system
type as described above.  <B>This is important even during the compile
process, because the maketa program will need to access shared libs</B>.

</P>
<P>
After setting appropriate definitions, go back up to the PDPDIR and just
do a:
<PRE>make world
</PRE>

<P>
this should compile everything.  This will make makefiles in each
directory based on your CPU type, and then compile the various libraries
and then the executables.

</P>
<P>
Most likely, the make will at least proceed past all the basic directory
initialization stuff that is part of <SAMP>`make world'</SAMP>.  Thus, if the
compile stops after making the makefiles and after making the
<TT>`maketa'</TT> program, you can fix the problem and re-start it by doing
<SAMP>`make all'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`make world'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
If you run into difficulties during the compile process, the programming
guide might contain some useful information for debugging what is going
wrong: section <A HREF="ta_css_28.html">6  Programming with TypeAccess</A>.
