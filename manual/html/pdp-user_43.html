<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>How do I present events with different frequencies?</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX78"></A>
 
There is a type of environment that implements frequency-based
presentation of events.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_146.html">11.10  Frequency Environments and Events</A> for details.  Note that you
can do <CODE>Change Type</CODE> on an existing environment to change it to a
frequency environment, retaining all the patterns, etc.  However, you'll
also need to convert the individual events to <B>FreqEvents</B> using
change type on them.  An alternative is to create a new FreqEnv, create
the proper number of Freq Events, and then do <CODE>CopyTo</CODE> on the
original environment to copy its stuff to the new one.

<DT><B>How do I present sequences of events in order?</B>
<DD>
This requires both a structured environment and a set of processes that
can use that structure to present sequences.  The environment must
simply have the events in sub-groups where each sub-group defines a
different sequence of events (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_139.html">11.3  Representing Sequences of Events</A>).  The <B>SequenceEpoch</B>
and the <B>SequenceProcess</B> work together to present sequenced events.
The <B>SequenceEpoch</B> iterates through the different sequences (groups)
of events (and determines if they are randomized or not at that level),
and the <B>SequenceProcess</B> iterates through the events in a given
sequence (and determines the order of the events themselves).  See
section <A HREF="pdp-user_162.html">12.6.1  Processes for Sequences of Events</A> for details.

<DT><B>How do I read patterns/events from a file?</B>
<DD>
The function <CODE>ReadText</CODE> on the <B>Environment</B> object will read
in events from a text file, including files formatted for the old PDP
software.  This file has a simple format.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_143.html">11.7  Importing Environments from Text Files</A> for
details on the file format and how to use the function.

<DT><B>How do I read patterns/events from a file INCREMENTALLY during training?</B>
<DD>
The object <B>FromFileEnv</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_147.html">11.11  Other Environment Types</A>) reads events one epoch
or one event at a time from a file (either text or binary format) for
presentation to the network.  This should be useful for very large
environments or very large patterns, or both.  Reading one event at a
time uses the "interactive" interface to the environment
(GetNextEvent) meaning that the <B>InteractiveEpoch</B> epoch process
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_163.html">12.6.2  Processes for Interactive Environments</A>) must be used.

<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<DT><B>How do I present an arbirarily-selected event to the network?</B>
<DD>
First, view the Environment that contains the event, scroll the list of
events to the desired one, and use the right-mouse-button to edit that
event.  This brings up an 'Edit' dialog, containing a 'PresentEvent'
button at the bottom.  Clicking this button will present the event using
the selected TrialProcess (which must already be created, and determines
which network is used, etc). 

<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<DT><B>How do I have some events that set the output target, and others</B>
<DD>
that don't, or more generally, have events do different things within
the environment?
How an event is presented to the network, and the very
configuration of the event itself, is determined by the <B>EventSpec</B>
and its associated <B>PatternSpec</B>s.  These can be configured by hitting
<I>Edit Specs</I> on the <B>EnviroView</B>.  To have different events do
different things, you need two (or more) different event specs.  Once
you have configured the different event specs, you can click on events
(after doing <I>Edit Events</I>) and select <I>View: Action/Set Event Spec</I>
to set the event specs for the selected events.

<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
<DT><B>How can I quickly update my Event specifications (pattern layout, size) from corresponding layers on the network.</B>
<DD>
Within the environment viewer, select <B>UpdateAllEventSpecs</B> in the
<I>Actions</I> menu -- this will automatically update the events to match
the current network geometry.  This function is also available in the
Wizard.

<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<DT><B>How do I create an interactive environment where events depend on network responses?</B>
<DD>
This is implemented through a combination of an
<B>InteractiveScriptEnv</B> environment (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_147.html">11.11  Other Environment Types</A>) and and an
<B>InteractiveEpoch</B> epoch process (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_163.html">12.6.2  Processes for Interactive Environments</A>).  See
<TT>`demo/leabra/nav.proj.gz'</TT> for a working example.

<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<DT><B>How do I label the event pattern values so I know what they stand for?</B>
<DD>
The <CODE>value_names</CODE> field in the <B>PatternSpec</B> provide labels for
the pattern values.  These can be edited in the enviro view in the
<I>Edit Specs</I> mode, by clicking on a pattern and hitting the <B>Edit
Names</B> button. To see them, you need to make sure the <B>Val Txt:</B>
field in the viewer is set to <B>NAMES</B> or <B>BOTH</B>.
