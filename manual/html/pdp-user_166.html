The <B>SaveNetsProc</B> and <B>SaveWtsProc</B> will simply save the current
network or network weights to a file which has a file name composed of
the name of the network (from its <CODE>name</CODE> field) plus the current
values of the epoch and, if present, the batch counters.  This can be
placed in the <CODE>loop_procs</CODE> or <CODE>final_procs</CODE> of the
<B>TrainProcess</B> or the <B>BatchProcess</B> to save networks during
training or after training, respectively.  Set the mod parameters to get
it to save at different intervals (e.g., <CODE>m = 25</CODE> saves every 25
epochs if in the train loop procs).

The <B>LoadWtsProc</B> will load in a set of weights from a specified
file, which is useful for example for performing repeated lesion tests
on a given trained network -- build the network, load the weights,
lesion it, test it, repeat!

The <B>InitWtsProc</B> will initialize the weights of a network.  The
<B>TrainProcess</B> does this automatically when it is initialized, but
there are other possible configurations of processes where you might
need to initialize the weights at a different point.

The <B>DispDataEnvProc</B> automatically performs an analysis of a data
environment (a data environment contains data recorded from the
network for the purposes of analysis, by the <CODE>CopyToEnvStat</CODE> stat
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_179.html">12.8.8  Miscellaneous Other Stat Types</A>). See section <A HREF="pdp-user_41.html">5.1  Questions about Processes</A> for an overview of how
this analysis process works, and section <A HREF="pdp-user_145.html">11.9  Environment Analysis Functions</A> for the types of
analyses that can be performed.  The data environment to analyze is
specified in <CODE>data_env</CODE> (the regular <CODE>environment</CODE> pointer
points to the environment actually used by the entire process
hierarchy, and is not used).  The type of analysis is specified in the
<CODE>disp_type</CODE> field, and the results of the analysis are displayed
in the log pointed to by the <CODE>disp_log</CODE> field (if this is NULL,
or the wrong type, a new one is made).  The remaining parameters are
used for different analysis routines, as described in greater detail
in section <A HREF="pdp-user_145.html">11.9  Environment Analysis Functions</A>.

The <B>DispNetWeightsProc</B> automatically displays the weights between
two layers of the <CODE>network</CODE> in a grid log.  Useful for monitoring
the development of the entire set of weights as the network learns
(the netview can only display the weights to one unit, whereas this
displays the weights to all units in the layer).  This is just a call
to the <CODE>GridViewWeights</CODE> function on the Network
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_113.html">10.1  The Network Object</A>).

There are a set of processes that reset other processes, stats, or
logs -- these are usually placed at a higher level of the processing
hierarchy in <CODE>init_procs</CODE>, to initialize things.  They are:
<B>UnitActRFStatResetProc</B>, <B>TimeCounterStatResetProc</B>, and
<B>ClearLogProc</B> -- their functions should be fairly obvious.
