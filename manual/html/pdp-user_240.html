The core set of Leabra processes consist of a <B>LeabraTrial</B> process that
performs the two phases of contrastive Hebbian learning (CHL), where
each phase of settling is controlled by a <B>LeabraSettle</B> process, which in
turn iterates over a number of individual <B>LeabraCycle</B> processing steps,
each of which updates the activation state of the network.  These
processes fit nicely within the standard settling and cycle processes
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_153.html">12.4  Schedule Processes for Different Time-Grains</A>).

</P>
<P>
The <B>LeabraTrial</B> process iterates over two loops of settle processing,
one for each phase.  It has the following variables:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Counter phase_order</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1630"></A>
Different orders of phases can be presented, as indicated by the
relatively self-explanatory options.  The <CODE>MINUS_PLUS_NOTHING</CODE>
option allows the network to learn to reconstruct its input state by
taking away any external inputs in an extra third phase, and using
this as a minus phase relative to the immediately preceding plus
phase.  The <CODE>MINUS_PLUS_PLUS</CODE> is used by more complex
working-memory/context algorithms for an extra step of updating of
context reps after the standard minus-plus learning phases.  Note that
the <B>PhaseOrderEventSpec</B> can be used to set the phase order on a
trial-by-trial basis.
<DT><CODE>Counter phase_no</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1631"></A>
The counter for this process, it goes from 0 to 1 for the two
different phases (or 2 for more phases).
<DT><CODE>Phase phase</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1632"></A>
The phase the process is in, which is just a more readable
version of the counter:  <CODE>MINUS_PHASE</CODE> and <CODE>PLUS_PHASE</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>StateInit trial_init</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1633"></A>
Indicates what to do at the start of each trial process.
Typically, one wants to <CODE>DECAY_STATE</CODE>, but it is also possible to
<CODE>INIT_NOTHING</CODE> or <CODE>DO_NOTHING</CODE>.  Decay state allows for
working memory across trials, as needed by several modifications to
Leabra.  The default decay parameters decay 100%, which makes it
equivalent to INIT_STATE.
<DT><CODE>bool no_plus_stats</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1634"></A>
This flag means that statistics will not be recorded in the plus phase.
This is useful because squared error, for example, is only meaningful in
the minus phase, since the correct answer is clamped in the plus phase.
<DT><CODE>bool no_plus_test</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1635"></A>
This flag means that the plus phase will not be run if the epoch process
indicates that it is in <CODE>TEST</CODE> mode (i.e., no learning is taking
place).

The <B>LeabraSettle</B> process iterates over cycles of settling
(activation updating).  <CODE>min_cycles</CODE> ensures that at least this
many cycles of processing occur.  It also contains several important
variables that control how activations are computed during settling.
<CODE>netin_mod</CODE> allows one to skip computing the net input every
other cycle (or more), which can result in more efficient computation
by allowing the membrane potentials to keep up better with netinput
changes, but values higher than 2 are not recommended and have
resulted in worse overall learning performance.  <CODE>send_delta</CODE>
is <B>very important for large networks</B> -- it results in
substantially faster processing by only sending netinput when the
sending activation <EM>changes</EM>, instead of sending it all the
time.  The amount of change that is required is specified in the unit
spec <CODE>opt_thresh</CODE> params.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1639"></A>
The settle process will use the <CODE>duration</CODE> field from a <B>DurEvent</B>
to set the max number of cycles to settle on a given event.

</P>
<P>
The <B>LeabraCycle</B> process updates the activation state of the
network.  It has no user-settable parameters.
