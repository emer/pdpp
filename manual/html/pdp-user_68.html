<H3><A NAME="IDX190" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">7.2.2  Debugging an Example Program in CSS</A></H3>

<P>
This section illustrates the use of the debugging facilities within CSS.
We will use the example program from the previous section, with the
addition of the two extra lines of code that were added in <CODE>define</CODE>
mode.  It is important to note that some important aspects of debugging
like breakpoints can only be used when a program was started with the
<CODE>run</CODE> command.  Thus, do not set breakpoints if you are going to be
simply calling a function on the command line.

</P>
<P>
There are three primary debugging tools in CSS: <B>breakpoints</B>,
<B>execution tracing</B>, and <B>single-stepping</B>.  Because CSS is
basically an interpreted system, all of the facilities for examining
variables, the stack, source code, etc. which must be added into a real
debugger come for "free" in CSS.

</P>
<P>
To illustrate, we will set a breakpoint in the <CODE>Decode_Number</CODE>
function (assuming you have loaded this code already):

</P>
<PRE>css&#62; list Decode_Number
(String) Decode_Number((Real) number) {
4         String rval = "The number, " + number + " is: ";
5         if(number &#60; 0)
6           rval += "negative";
7         else if(number &#60; .5)
8           rval += "less than .5";
9         else if(number &#60; 1)
10          rval += "less than 1";
11        else
12          rval += "greater than 1";
13        return rval;
14      }
css&#62; setbp 5
css&#62; showbp
Decode_Number   5         if(number &#60; 0)
css&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that we first listed the function (referring to it by name), and
then set a breakpoint with the <CODE>setbp</CODE> command at line number 5.
We then confirmed this breakpoint with the <CODE>showbp</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
Now, when we <CODE>run</CODE> the program, execution will stop at line 5, and
we will be returned to the <CODE>css&#62;</CODE> prompt:

</P>
<PRE>css&#62; run
2 css&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
which has changed to <CODE>2 css&#62;</CODE>, indicating that we are 2 levels deep
into the execution of the program.  To see where we are, <CODE>list</CODE> and
<CODE>status</CODE> can be used:

</P>
<PRE>2 css&#62; list

Listing of Program: css_example.css
4         String rval = "The number, " + number + " is: ";
5         if(number &#60; 0)
6           rval += "negative";
7         else if(number &#60; .5)
8           rval += "less than .5";
9         else if(number &#60; 1)
10          rval += "less than 1";
11        else
12          rval += "greater than 1";
13        return rval;
14      }
28      list
2 css&#62; status

        Status of Program: css_example.css
curnt:  Decode_Number   src_ln: 5       pc:     9
debug:  0       step:   0       depth:  2       conts:  2
lines:  29      list:   28
State: shell:   1   run: 0  cont:   0  defn:   0  runlast: 0
run status:     Waiting
shell cmd:      None
2 css&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>src_ln</CODE> of the status output tells us which source-code line
we are at (and what function we are in).  Here, we can use the
interactive mode of css to determine the values of our variables:

</P>
<PRE>2 css&#62; print number
(Real) number = 0.75
2 css&#62; print rval
(String) rval = The number, 0.75 is:
</PRE>

<P>
The values of all of the variables for the current "frame" (there is one
frame for every call to a given function, or any expression appearing
between the curly-brackets) can be viewed at once with the <CODE>frame</CODE>
command:

</P>
<PRE>2 css&#62; frame

Elements of Spaces For Program: Decode_Number (frame = 1)

Elements of Space: Autos (3)
(String) _retv_this =                   (Real) number = 0.75
(String) rval = The number, 0.75 is:

Elements of Space: Stack (0)

Elements of Space: css_example.css.Static (3)
(String) Decode_Number((Real) number)   (void) Decode_Random((Int) n_numbers)
(String) foo = a string
</PRE>

<P>
Included in the frame information are the "automatic" variables
(<CODE>Autos</CODE>), and the contents of the stack.  To get information on
previous frames in the execution sequence, use the command <CODE>trace</CODE>,
which gives both a trace of processing and can give a dump of the entire
stack up to this point if given a higher "trace level", which is an
optional argument to the <CODE>trace</CODE> command.  The default trace level
of 0 just shows the frames, 1 also shows the stack, 2 also shows the
auto variables, and 3 shows all variables.  In addition, just the
contents of the current stack can be viewed with the <CODE>stack</CODE>
command (note that the saved stack is what is actually used by the
program during execution).

</P>
<P>
In addition to viewing variables, it is possible to change their
values:

</P>
<PRE>2 css&#62; number = 200;
2 css&#62; print number
(Real) number = 200
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, to continue the program from where it was stopped by the
breakpoint, use the <CODE>cont</CODE> command:

</P>
<PRE>2 css&#62; cont
The number, 0.75 is: greater than 1
5 css&#62; 
</PRE>

<P>
Since we changed the number after it was turned into a string for the
<CODE>rval</CODE>, but before the <CODE>if</CODE> statements, we got the
contradictory result printed above.  Also, because the breakpoint is
still in effect, the program has stopped due to the <CODE>Decode_Random</CODE>
function calling the <CODE>Decode_Number</CODE> function.  We can continue
again, or we can disable the breakpoint first, and then continue.  

</P>
<PRE>5 css&#62; cont
0       The number, 0.764017 is: less than 1
5 css&#62; unsetbp 5
5 css&#62; showbp
5 css&#62; cont
1       The number, -1.76456 is: negative
2       The number, 1.59942 is: greater than 1
3       The number, -1.34582 is: negative
4       The number, -1.36371 is: negative
css&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the breakpoint is referred to by the source-code line number.

</P>
<P>
Another way to debug is to get a trace of the running program.  This can
be done by setting the <CODE>debug</CODE> level, which can have a value from 0
(normal, quiet operation) through 4, with higher levels giving more
detail than lower levels.  For most users, levels 0 and 1 are the only
ones needed, since the higher levels depend on understanding the guts of
the CSS machine code.  Debug level 1 shows the source-code line
corresponding to the currently-executing code:

</P>
<PRE>css&#62; debug 1
css&#62; run
31      run
3       String Decode_Number(float number) {
17      void Decode_Random(int n_numbers) {
26      cout &#60;&#60; Decode_Number(.75) &#60;&#60; "\n";
4         String rval = "The number, " + number + " is: ";
5         if(number &#60; 0)
5         if(number &#60; 0)
5         if(number &#60; 0)
7         else if(number &#60; .5)
7         else if(number &#60; .5)
7         else if(number &#60; .5)
9         else if(number &#60; 1)
9         else if(number &#60; 1)
9         else if(number &#60; 1)
10          rval += "less than 1";
13        return rval;
26      cout &#60;&#60; Decode_Number(.75) &#60;&#60; "\n";
The number, 0.75 is: less than 1
27      Decode_Random(5);
18        int i;
19        for(i=0; i&#60;n_numbers; i++) {
.
.
.
</PRE>

<P>
Since running proceeds from the top to the bottom, the definitions of
the functions appear in the trace even though they do not really do
anything.  Also, some constructs like <CODE>if</CODE> and <CODE>for</CODE> result in
multiple copies of the same source-code line being printed.  This kind
of trace is useful for seeing what branches of the code are being taken,
etc.

</P>
<P>
The final kind of debugging is single-stepping, which is like having a
breakpoint after every line of source code.  Execution continues after
each point by simply entering a blank line:

</P>
<PRE>css&#62; debug 0
31      debug 0
css&#62; step 1
css&#62; run
31      run
3       String Decode_Number(float number) {
1 css&#62;
17      void Decode_Random(int n_numbers) {
1 css&#62;
26      cout &#60;&#60; Decode_Number(.75) &#60;&#60; "\n";
4         String rval = "The number, " + number + " is: ";
2 css&#62; print number
31      print number
(Real) number = 0.75
2 css&#62; print rval
(String) rval = The number, 0.75 is:
5         if(number &#60; 0)
3 css&#62;
7         else if(number &#60; .5)
4 css&#62;
9         else if(number &#60; 1)
5 css&#62;
10          rval += "less than 1";
4 css&#62;
13        return rval;
26      cout &#60;&#60; Decode_Number(.75) &#60;&#60; "\n";
The number, 0.75 is: less than 1
1 css&#62;
27      Decode_Random(5);
18        int i;
2 css&#62;
19        for(i=0; i&#60;n_numbers; i++) {
19        for(i=0; i&#60;n_numbers; i++) {
20          float number = 4.0 * (drand48()-.5);
4 css&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
(note that we turned debugging off, since it is redundant with
single-stepping).  The <CODE>step</CODE> command takes an argument, which is
the number of lines to step over (typically 1). Then, when we <CODE>run</CODE>
the program again, it stops after every line.  If you simply want to
continue running, you can just hit return and it will continue to the
next line.

</P>
<P>
If at any point during debugging you want to stop the execution of the
program and return to the top-level (i.e., get rid of that number in
front of the prompt), use the <CODE>restart</CODE> command.

</P>
<PRE>4 css&#62; restart
34      restart
css&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Be sure not to confuse <CODE>restart</CODE> with <CODE>reset</CODE>, as the latter
will erase the current program from memory (you can just reload it with
<CODE>reload</CODE>, so its not so bad if you do).
