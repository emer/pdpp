This section describes the main ways in which the many tasks involved in
neural network simulation have been divided up and assigned to different
types of objects.  It is essential to understand this division of labor
in order to use the software effectively.

</P>
<P>
There are four central components to a neural network simulation as we
see it:

<IL>
<LI>The <B>Network</B>, including layers, units, connections, etc.

(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_112.html">10  Networks (Layers, Units, etc)</A>).
<LI>The <B>Environment</B> on which the network is to be trained and

tested (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_135.html">11  Environments, Events, and Patterns</A>).
<LI>The <B>Processing</B> or <B>Scheduling</B> of training and testing a

network, which determines how long to train the network, with what
environment, etc. (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_148.html">12  Processes and Statistics</A>).
<LI>The <B>Logging</B> of the results of training and testing.  One

can view these results as a graph, a table of numbers, or a grid of
color chips that represent values in a graphical similar to that used in
the viewing of networks (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_181.html">13  Logs and Graphs</A>).
</IL>

<P>
Since all of these components work together in a given simulation, we
have grouped them all under a <B>Project</B> object (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_102.html">9  Projects (and Defaults, Scripts)</A>), which
also has some additional objects (defaults and scripts) that make life
easier.  Thus, when you start a simulation, the first thing you do is
create a new project, and then start creating networks, environments,
etc. within this project.

</P>
<P>
<B>New for 2.0:</B> There is now a graphical interface for the
project-level organization of objects, which can really help make
complex projects more managable, especially for dealing with the
processing aspects of things.  Just enlarge your project window on
existing projects to see the new view.

</P>
<P>
<B>New for 3.0:</B> The complexity of dealing with distributed objects is
partially simplified through the introduction of a <B>Wizard</B> object
that automates the contstruction of typically-used network simulation
objects.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_45.html">5.5  The Wizard Object</A> for details.  Also new are principal
components analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS)
techniques for analyzing network representations
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_145.html">11.9  Environment Analysis Functions</A>), and much imporoved graph log features for
displaying overlapping traces of data, including a spike raster plot.
In addition, distributed memory parallel processing support, both for
connection-level and event-level parallelism, was added.

Of the different simulation components, Processing (aka Scheduling) is
probably the least intuitive.  Indeed, we might have decided instead
that networks knew how to train themselves, or that environments would
know how to train networks.  The main reasons we chose to make
Processing a separate major category of function in the software are: 1)
The ways in which one trains and tests a network are common to different
types of networks and learning algorithms. 2) Many different kinds of
training and testing processing can be performed on the same network and
environment.  3) Processing depends in part on the nature of the network
and the nature of the environment, so that putting this task in either
of these separately would lead to strange dependencies of networks on
environments or vice versa.

</P>
<P>
Thus, one can think of the processing function as being similar to that
of a movie director, who coordinates the actors and the camera
operators, set designers, etc. to produce a finished product.
Similarly, the processing coordinates the network with the environment
and other elements to direct the overall process of training and
testing.  For more information on how processing is implemented in the
software see section <A HREF="pdp-user_150.html">12.2  The Schedule Process (SchedProcess)</A>.
