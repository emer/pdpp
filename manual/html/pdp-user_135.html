Conceptually, a network always acts in an environment of some kind. For
example, back propagation and pattern associator networks act in an
environment of input-output patterns. An unsupervised learning network
operates in an environment consisting of input patterns.

</P>
<P>
In PDP++, the object of type <B>Environment</B> contains all the
information that specifies the kinds of stimuli or patterns that the
network will be tested or trained on.  The role of the environment is to
represent all of the data, structured so that the data can be
interpreted by the processes and presented to the network appropriately.
Thus, it is like a database or a library.  The environment does not
specify things like the <EM>order</EM> with which events will be presented
to the network--this is the job of the processes, which, to continue the
metaphor, act like librarians in providing the interface between the
data (the environment) and the consumer (the network).

</P>
<P>
There is a special relationship between the <B>EventSpec</B>, which
specifies properties of events, and the <B>Event</B> objects themselves.
Any changes made to the event spec (or its pattern specs), for example
in the number of patterns per event or size of one of the patterns, are
automatically propagated to all of the events that use the event spec.
Thus, the <B>EventSpec</B> acts much like a dynamic template for events,
which is a different role for a spec object.  This design makes it very
easy to modify environments once they've been created.

</P>
<P>
The <B>EnviroView</B> enables you to interactively configure the event
specs for the events, much in the same way the net view allows one to
configure networks.  In the standard color scheme, environment objects
are colored green (like the great outdoors!).
