All PDP++ objects can also be saved to a file and loaded back in from
that file.  Note that when you save an object that has sub-objects in it
(i.e. a Layer, which has Units in it), those sub-objects are also saved
in the file, and loaded back in as well.  Thus, to save all the elements
of a project, one only has to save the project object, which will
automatically save all of its sub-objects.

</P>
<P>
There are two ways in which objects can be loaded back in: in one case,
you load the file <EM>over</EM> an existing object.  This corresponds to
the <I>Load Over</I> menu item that you will frequently see in PDP++.  This
will simply replace the values of the existing object with those saved
in the file.  This also applies to any sub-objects. Note if the existing
object has <EM>fewer</EM> of some kind of sub-object than the saved file,
new sub-objects will be created as needed.  However, the same is not
also true if the existing object has <EM>more</EM> of these
sub-objects--they are not removed to make the existing object exactly
the same as that which was saved in the file.  If you want to make sure
the object is exactly as it was saved, open a new one, do not open over
an existing one.

</P>
<P>
To open a new object from a saved file, use the <I>Open in</I> menu item
(instead of <I>Load Over</I>).  This is equivalent to opening a new item
into a parent group object.  For example, the project has a group that
contains its networks.  If you open a saved network file in this group,
as opposed to over an existing network in the group, a new network will
automatically be created (along with all of its saved substructure).

</P>
<P>
Some types of objects have default "extensions" that are automatically
added on to the file name to identify the type of file.  For example,
projects are saved with a <TT>`.proj'</TT> extension.  Further, some objects
automatically compress the file after saving, (and automatically
uncompress it before loading) in order to save disk space.  This is
because the file format objects are saved in is actually text-based and
human readable.  Thus, it is much more efficient to save large files in
a compressed form.  These files automatically get the compression suffix
associated with the type of compression used (.gz for gzip, which is the
default).
