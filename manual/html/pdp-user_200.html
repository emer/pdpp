In addition to the weight itself, the connection type in Bp,
<B>BpCon</B>, has two additional variables:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>float dwt</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1216"></A>
The most recently computed change in the weight term.  It is
computed in the <CODE>UpdateWeights</CODE> function.
<DT><CODE>float dEdW</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1217"></A>
The accumulating derivative of the error with respect to the
weights.  It is computed in the <CODE>Compute_dWt</CODE> function.  It will
accumulate until the <CODE>UpdateWeights</CODE> function is called, which will
either be on a trial-by-trial or epoch-wise (batch mode) basis.
</DL>

<P>
The connection specifications control the behavior and updating of
connections (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_127.html">10.5  Connections</A>).  Thus, in Bp, this is where you will
find thinks like the learning rate and momentum parameters.  A detailed
description of the parameters is given below:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>float lrate</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1218"></A>
The learning rate parameter.  It controls how fast the weights
are updated along the computed error gradient.  It should generally be
less than 1 and harder problems will require smaller learning rates.
<DT><CODE>float momentum</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1219"></A>
The momentum parameter determines how much of the previous weight change
will be retained in the present weight change computation.  Thus,
weight changes can build up momentum over time if they all head in the
same direction, which can speed up learning.  Typical values are from .5
to .9, with anything much lower than .5 making little difference.
<DT><CODE>MomentumType momentum_type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1220"></A>
There are a couple of different ways of thinking about how momentum
should be applied, and this variable controls which one is used.
According to <CODE>AFTER_LRATE</CODE>, momentum is added to the weight
change <EM>after</EM> the learning rate has been applied:
<PRE>  cn-&#62;dwt = lrate * cn-&#62;dEdW + momentum * cn-&#62;dwt;
  cn-&#62;wt += cn-&#62;dwt;
</PRE>

This was used in the original pdp software.  The <CODE>BEFORE_LRATE</CODE>
model holds that momentum is something to be applied to the gradient
computation itself, not to the actual weight changes made.  Thus,
momentum is computed <EM>before</EM> the learning rate is applied to the
weight gradient:
<PRE>  cn-&#62;dwt = cn-&#62;dEdW + momentum * cn-&#62;dwt;
  cn-&#62;wt += lrate * cn-&#62;dwt;
</PRE>

Finally, both of the previous forms of momentum introduce a learning
rate confound since higher momentum values result in larger effective
weight changes when the previous weight change points in the same
direction as the current one.  This is controlled for in the
<CODE>NORMALIZED</CODE> momentum update, which normalizes the total
contribution of the previous and current weight changes (it also uses
the <CODE>BEFORE_LRATE</CODE> model of when momentum should be applied):
<PRE>  cn-&#62;dwt = (1.0 - momentum) * cn-&#62;dEdW + momentum * cn-&#62;dwt;
  cn-&#62;wt += lrate * cn-&#62;dwt;
</PRE>

Note that normalized actually uses a variable called <CODE>momentum_c</CODE>
which is pre-computed to be 1.0 - momentum, so that this extra
computation is not incurred needlessly during actual weight updates.
<DT><CODE>float decay</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1221"></A>
Controls the magnitude of weight decay, if any.  If the
corresponding <CODE>decay_fun</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE> weight decay is not
performed.  However, if it is set, then the weight decay will be scaled
by this parameter.  Note that weight decay is applied <EM>before</EM>
either momentum or the learning rate is applied, so that its effects are
relatively invariant with respect to manipulations of these other
parameters.
<DT><CODE>decay_fun</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1222"></A>
The decay function to be used in computing weight decay.  This is a
pointer to a function, which means that the user can add additional
decay functions as they wish.  However, the default ones are
<CODE>Bp_Simple_WtDecay</CODE>, which simply subtracts a fraction of the
current weight value, and <CODE>Bp_WtElim_WtDecay</CODE>, which uses the
"weight elimination" procedure of <CITE>Weigand, Rumelhart, and
Huberman, 1991</CITE>.  This procedure allows large weights to avoid a strong
decay pressure, but small weights are encouraged to be eliminated:
<PRE>  float denom = 1.0 + (cn-&#62;wt * cn-&#62;wt);	
  cn-&#62;dEdW -= spec-&#62;decay * ((2 * cn-&#62;wt) / (denom * denom);
</PRE>

The ratio of the weight to the <CODE>denom</CODE> value is roughly
proportional to the weight itself for small weights, and is constant for
weights larger than 1.
