The <B>SelectEdit</B> object consolidates multiple different fields and
functions from different objects into one edit dialog.  Typically, one
selects the fields by editing the object in question, and using the
<B>Object/SelectForEdit</B> menu option to select the field to be edited,
or <B>Object/SelectFunForEdit</B> to select a function to be accessible
from the select edit dialog.

</P>
<P>
The select edit dialog always has as its first line a <CODE>config</CODE>
field, which contains configuration information for the select edit
dialog itself.  The <CODE>auto_edit</CODE> toggle specifies whether the
select edit dialog is opened automatically whenever the project is
opened.  The <CODE>mbr_labels</CODE> contains extra user-specified labels to
append before the field member names, to specify which object they
came from.  The <CODE>meth_labels</CODE> contains similar such labels for
methods (functions).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>SelectEdit</CODE> menu on the edit dialog contains functions for
Removing and Moving fields and functions within the edit dialog.  The
<CODE>New Edit</CODE> function closes the current edit dialog and re-opens
it.  Use this if you have edited member or method labels, and want to
see them reflected in the edit dialog.
