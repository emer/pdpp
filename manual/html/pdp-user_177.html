<H3><A NAME="IDX1072" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">12.8.6  Reaction-time Based on Crossing an Activation Threshold</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1073"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1074"></A>
The <B>ActThreshRTStat</B> records a reaction time (RT) from the network
based on when activation levels in given layer (typically the output
layer) exceed threshold. Experience in a variety of cases has shown
that human reaction times can be best modeled by recording the number
of processing cycles it takes for a response/output layer unit to
exceed some kind of activity threshold.  In contrast, recording RT
based on the change in activation over time going below a threshold
(in <TT>`cs++'</TT> this is <B>CsMaxDa</B>; in <TT>`leabra++'</TT> it is
<B>LeabraMaxDa</B>) is typically not such a good measure of human
reaction time.

</P>
<P>
This stat should typically be created in the <CODE>loop_stats</CODE> of the
<B>SettleProcess</B>.  To configure this stat, just set the <CODE>layer</CODE>
pointer to point to the response/output layer in the network, and set
the <CODE>act_thresh</CODE> to the activation threshold.  Two values are
recorded in this stat:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>max_act</CODE> records the maximum activation in the response layer,
and setting a stopcrit on this will actually result in stopping
settling upon reaching threshold (note that the val of this stopcrit
is automatically set to be the same as the <CODE>act_thresh</CODE> value,
but the stopcrit flag is not active by default, so that it will not
stop processing).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>rt_cycles</CODE> records the number of settling cycles at the point
when the maximum activation in the layer exceeded the <CODE>max_act</CODE>
threshold (regardless of whether the settle process actually
stopped at this point).
