<P>
The <B>BpTrial</B> process is the only Bp-specific process type needed
to perform simple feed-forward backprop.  The <CODE>Loop</CODE> function of
this process simply propagates activation forwards through the network,
and then propagates the error backwards.  This assumes that the layers
are ordered sequentially in a feed-forward manner.  Note that the
process does not actually "loop" over anything, so it has no counter.
See section <A HREF="pdp-user_158.html">12.5.1  Presenting a Single Event: TrialProcess</A> for more information on the trial process
type.

<P>
The following functions are defined on the trial process, each of which
performs one step of the backpropagation computations:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Compute_Act()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1236"></A>
Goes layer-by-layer and computes the net input and the activation of the
units in the layer.
<DT><CODE>Compute_Error()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1237"></A>
Computes the error on the output units, which is only done during
testing, and not training.
<DT><CODE>Compute_dEdA_dEdNet()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1238"></A>
Computes the derivative of the error with respect to the activation and
then with respect to the net inputs.  This goes in reverse order
through the layers of the network.
<DT><CODE>Compute_dWt()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1239"></A>
Computes the dEdW for all the weights in the network.
