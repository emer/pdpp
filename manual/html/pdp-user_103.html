Every object in PDP++ can be saved to a file, and loaded back in later
from that file (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_90.html">8.1.3  Saving and Loading Objects</A>).  Typically, a user will
simply save and load the project object, since it contains all the other
objects of interest, which will be saved and loaded along with it.
However, it is often a good idea to save parts of the project,
particularly environments, since that makes it possible to load these
parts into other projects.

</P>
<P>
A saved project file is actually human readable (once it is
uncompressed), and you can pull it up in your favorite text editor (if
its not too big for it), and see exactly what parameters were used, etc.
This is much easier to do if you just save all of your specs, which
contain most of the interesting parameters in the project.  Thus, saved
files serve as records of exactly how your simulation was configured.

</P>
<P>
It is recommended that you save your project frequently, in the
unlikely event of a program crash.  However, even if you have not saved
the project and it does crash, a recover file is automatically created.

</P>
<P>
These recover files are named <CODE>PDP++Recover.#.proj.gz</CODE>, where the
number # of the saved file will increment to be unique in the directory.
You can typically load this file back in and resume where you left off.
Always check the loaded project to ensure that it looks reasonable --
sometimes the crash will cause the project file to be corrupted, though
this is relatively rare.  Any reliable crash should be reported to the
developers, along with a project file and steps to reproduce the crash.
See section <A HREF="pdp-user_1.html">1  Introduction to the PDP++ Software</A>.

There is now an option to record an entry in a <B>SimLog</B> file every
time you do <CODE>Save As</CODE> on your project file.  This SimLog file
records the user, date, current and previous project file names,
together with comments that the user can enter as they save the
project (e.g., what parameters were manipulated, etc).  This is
strongly recommended, as it is often quite difficult to remember what
was going on with a project when one comes back to it, even after just
a few weeks away!  If you decide not to use it, you can click the
<CODE>use_sim_log</CODE> flag off on the little dialog that comes up as you
are saving.
