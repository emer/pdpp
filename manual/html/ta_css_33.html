<P>
The classes used in storing type information in the TypeAccess system
are all defined in the <TT>`ta/typea.h'</TT> header file.  Basically, there
are a set of <B>Space</B> objects, which all derive from a basic form of
the <CODE>List</CODE> object (defined in <TT>`ta/ta_list.h'</TT>, which represent
type spaces, member spaces, method spaces, etc.  These are just
containers of objects.  The spaces are: <B>TypeSpace</B>, <B>MemberSpace</B>,
<B>MethodSpace</B>, <B>EnumSpace</B>, <B>TokenSpace</B>.  Note that they contain
functions for finding, printing, and generally manipulating the objects
they contain.

</P>
<P>
There are corresponding <B>TypeDef</B>, <B>MemberDef</B>, <B>MethodDef</B>, and
<B>EnumDef</B> objects which hold specific information about the
corresponding aspect of type information.  The <B>TypeDef</B> contains the
following fields:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>String name</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
Holds the name of the type.
<DT><CODE>String desc</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
A description which is obtained from the user's comment
following the declaration of the type.
<DT><CODE>uint size</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
The size of the object in bytes.
<DT><CODE>int ptr</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
The number of pointers this type is from a basic non-pointer type.
<DT><CODE>bool ref</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
True if this is a reference type.
<DT><CODE>bool internal</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
True if this type information was automatically or internally
generated.  This typically refers to pointer and reference types which
were created when the scanner encountered their use in arguments or
members of other classes that were being scanned.
<DT><CODE>bool formal</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
True for basic level objects like <CODE>TA_class</CODE> and
<CODE>TA_template</CODE> which are are formal parents (<CODE>par_formal</CODE>) of
types that users declare.  These provide a way of determining some basic
features of the type.  Formal type objects are declared and installed
automatically by the type scanning system.
<DT><CODE>bool pre_parsed</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
True if this type was registered as previously parsed by the
type scanning system (i.e., it encountered an <SAMP>`extern TypeDef
TA_xxx'</SAMP> for this type, where xxx is the name of the type).  These types
don't get included in the list of types for this directory.  This
makes it possible to do type scanning on a complex set of nested
libraries.
<DT><CODE>String_PArray inh_opts</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
These are the options (comment directives) that are inherited by this
type (i.e., those declared with a <CODE>##</CODE> instead of a <CODE>#</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>String_PArray opts</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
These are all of the options (comment directives) for this type,
including inherited and non-inherited ones.
<DT><CODE>String_PArray lists</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
A list of the <CODE>#LIST_xxx</CODE> values declared for this type.
<DT><CODE>TypeSpace parents</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
A list of parents of this type.  There are multiple parents for
multiple-inheritance <CODE>class</CODE> types, and for <CODE>internal</CODE> types
which are the combination of basic types, such as <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>,
etc.
<DT><CODE>int_PArray par_off</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
A list of offsets from the start of memory occupied by this
class where the parent object begins.  These are used for multiply
inherited class types.  They are in a one-to-one correspondence with the
<CODE>parents</CODE> entries.
<DT><CODE>TypeSpace par_formal</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
A list of the formal parents of this type, including
<CODE>TA_class</CODE>, etc.
<DT><CODE>TypeSpace par_cache</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
A special cache of frequently-queried type parents.  Currently
if a type derives from <B>taBase</B>, then <CODE>TA_taBase</CODE> shows up here
(because a lot of the TypeAccess code checks if something is derived
from the basic type-aware type <B>taBase</B>).
<DT><CODE>TypeSpace children</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
A list of all the types that are derived from this one.
<DT><CODE>void** instance</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
A pointer to a pointer of an instance of this type, if it is
kept.  The <CODE>GetInstance</CODE> function should be used to get the actual
instance pointer.
<DT><CODE>TokenSpace tokens</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
A list of the actual instances or tokens of this type that have
been created by the user (the <CODE>TAI_xxx</CODE> instance object is not
registered here).  These are not kept if the type does not record tokens
(see the <CODE>#NO_TOKENS</CODE> comment directive, section <A HREF="ta_css_37.html">6.3.1  Object Directives</A>).
<DT><CODE>taivType* iv</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
A pointer to an object which defines how a token of this type
appears in a GUI edit dialog.  There is a "bidding" procedure which
assigns these objects, allowing for the user to add new specialized
representations which out-bid the standard ones.  This bidding takes
place when the gui stuff is initialized, and the results are stored
here.
<DT><CODE>taivEdit* ive</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
This is like the <CODE>iv</CODE> pointer, except it is the object which is
used to generate the entire edit dialog for this object.  It also
is the result of a bidding procedure.
<DT><CODE>taBase_Group* defaults</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
These are pointers to different <B>TypeDefault</B> objects for this type.
Each <B>TypeDefault</B> object is for a different scope where these types
can be created (i.e., a different <B>Project</B> in the PDP++ software).
<DT><CODE>EnumSpace enum_vals</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
Contains the enum objects contained within a given <CODE>enum</CODE>
declaration.
<DT><CODE>TypeSpace sub_types</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
These are the sub-types declared with a <CODE>typedef</CODE>, <CODE>enum</CODE>, or
as part of a template instantiation within a <CODE>class</CODE> object.
<DT><CODE>MemberSpace members</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
These are the members of a <CODE>class</CODE> object.
<DT><CODE>MethodSpace methods</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
These are the methods of a <CODE>class</CODE> object.
<DT><CODE>TypeSpace templ_pars</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
These are the template parameters for template objects.  In the
<CODE>template</CODE> itself, they are the formal parameters (i.e., <CODE>T</CODE>),
but in the template instance they point to the actual types with which
the template was instantiated.
</DL>

<P>
The most important functions on the <B>TypeDef</B> object are as follows:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>bool HasOption(const char* op)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
Checks to see if the given option (comment directive) (don't
include the <CODE>#</CODE>) is present on this type.
<DT><CODE>String OptionAfter(const char* op)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
Returns the portion of the option (comment directive) after the
given part.  This is used for things like <CODE>#MENU_ON_xxx</CODE> to obtain
the xxx part.  If option is not present, an empty string is returned.
<DT><CODE>InheritsFrom(TypeDef* tp)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
Checks if this type inherits from the given one (versions that take
a string and a reference to a <B>TypeDef</B> are also defined).
Inheritance is defined only for classes, not for a pointer to a given
class, for example.  Thus, both the argument and the type this is called
on must be non-pointer, non-reference types.
<DT><CODE>DerivesFrom(TypeDef* tp)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
Simply checks if the given type appears anywhere in the list of
parents for this type.  Thus, a pointer to a class derives from that
class, but it does not inherit from it.
<DT><CODE>String GetValStr(void* base, void* par=NULL, MemberDef* memb_def=NULL)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
Uses the type-scanned information to obtain a string representation
of the value of an instance of this type.  <CODE>base</CODE> is a pointer to
the start of a token of this type, and <CODE>par</CODE> and <CODE>member_def</CODE>
can be passed if it is known that this token is in a parent class at a
particular member def.  This and the following function are used widely,
including for saving and loading of objects, etc.
<DT><CODE>SetValStr(const char* val, void* base, void* par=NULL, MemberDef* memb_def=NULL)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
Takes a string representation of a type instance, and sets the
value of the token accordingly (it is the inverse of <CODE>GetValStr</CODE>). 
<DT><CODE>CopyFromSameType(void* trg_base, void* src_base, MemberDef* memb_def=NULL)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
Uses the type-scanned information to copy from one type instance to
the next.  Any class objects that are members are copied using that
object's copy operator if one is defined (this is only known for
derivatives of the <B>taBase</B> base class).
<DT><CODE>Dump_Save(ostream&#38; strm, void* base, void* par=NULL, int indent=0)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
This will save the given type object to a file.  Files are saved in an
ASCII format, and are capable of saving pointers to other objects when
these objects derive from the <B>taBase</B> object.  Special code is
present for dealing with groups of objects stored in the <B>taList</B> or
<B>taGroup</B> classes.  See section <A HREF="ta_css_35.html">6.2.5  The Dump-file Format for Saving/Loading</A> for more details.
<DT><CODE>Dump_Load(istream&#38; strm, void* base, void* par=NULL)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
This will load a file saved by the <CODE>Dump_Save</CODE> command.
</DL>

<P>
The other <B>Def</B> objects are fairly straightforward.  Each includes a
<CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>desc</CODE> field, and a list of <CODE>opts</CODE> (comment
directives) and <CODE>lists</CODE>.  Also, each contains an <CODE>iv</CODE> field
which represents the item in the GUI edit dialog, and is the result of a
bidding process (see the <CODE>iv</CODE> field in the <B>TypeDef</B> object
above).  They all have the <CODE>HasOption</CODE> and <CODE>OptionAfter</CODE>
functions plus a number of other useful functions (see the
<TT>`ta/typea.h'</TT> for details).

</P>
<P>
<B>MemberDef</B> objects contain the following additional fields. Note that
derived classes contain links (<EM>not copies</EM>) of the members and
methods they inherit from their parent, except when the class has
multiple parents, in which case copies are made for the derived class
because the offset information will no longer be the same for the
derived class.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TypeDef* type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
The type of the member.
<DT><CODE>ta_memb_ptr off</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>
The address or offset of this member relative to the start of
the memory allocated for the class in which this member was declared.
<DT><CODE>int base_off</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
The offset to add to the base address (address of the start of
the class object) to obtain the start of the class this member was
declared in.  This is for members of parents of multiply-inherited
derived classes.
<DT><CODE>bool is_static</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
True if the member was declared <CODE>static</CODE>.  Thus, it can be
accessed without a <CODE>this</CODE> pointer.  The <CODE>addr</CODE> field contains
its absolute address.
<DT><CODE>void* addr</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX226"></A>
The absolute address (not relative to the class object) of a
static member.
<DT><CODE>bool fun_ptr</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
True if the member is actually a pointer to a function.
</DL>

<P>
The <B>MethodDef</B> object contains the following additional variables:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX228"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TypeDef* type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX229"></A>
The type of the method.
<DT><CODE>bool is_static</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX230"></A>
True if the method was declared <CODE>static</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>ta_void_fun addr</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
The address of a <CODE>static</CODE> method.  Non-static methods do
not have their addresses recorded.  Methods are called via the
<CODE>stubp</CODE> function, if the <CODE>-css</CODE> option was used during
scanning.
<DT><CODE>int fun_overld</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX232"></A>
The number of times this function was overloaded (i.e., a
function of the same name was declared in the class or its parents).
TypeAccess does not perform name mangling on functions, so only one
instance of a given method is recorded.  It is the last one that the
scanner encounters that is kept.
<DT><CODE>int fun_argc</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX233"></A>
The number of arguments for this function.
<DT><CODE>int fun_argd</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
The index where the arguments start having default values.
Thus, the function can be called with a variable number of arguments
from <CODE>fun_argd</CODE> to <CODE>fun_argc</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>TypeSpace arg_types</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
These are the types of the arguments.
<DT><CODE>String_PArray arg_names</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
These are the names of the arguements (in one-to-one correspondence with
the types).
<DT><CODE>css_fun_stub_ptr stubp</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX237"></A>
A pointer to a "stub" function which calls this method using
<B>cssEl</B> objects as arguments.  This function is defined in the
<TT>`xxx_TA.cc'</TT> file if the <CODE>-css</CODE> argument is given to
<TT>`maketa'</TT>.  The <B>cssEl</B> objects have conversion functions for most
types of arguments, so that the function is called by casting the
arguments into the types expected by the function.  Pointers to class
objects are handled by <CODE>cssTA</CODE> objects which have a pointer and a
corresponding <CODE>TypeDef</CODE> pointer, so they know what kind of object
they point to, making conversion type-safe.  These stubs return a cssEl
object.  They also take a <CODE>void*</CODE> for the <CODE>this</CODE> object.
These stubs are used both by CSS and to call methods from the edit
dialogs from menus and buttons.
