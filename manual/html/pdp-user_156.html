The <B>EpochProcess</B> loops over the set of Events in the Environment
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_135.html">11  Environments, Events, and Patterns</A>). Each presentation of an event is known as a <I>trial</I>,
and this process typically has a <B>TrialProcess</B> as its
<CODE>sub_proc</CODE>, although the situation is different when the
environment contains sequences of events (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_162.html">12.6.1  Processes for Sequences of Events</A>).

</P>
<P>
The epoch process is responsible for ordering the presentation of events
to the network.  Thus, at the beginning of the epoch (when the process
is initialized), it tells the environment to initialize itself (using
<CODE>InitEvents()</CODE>), and then obtains the total number of events in the
environment (using <CODE>EventCount()</CODE>, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_136.html">11.1  Environments</A>).  The epoch
process then makes a list of event indexes, which represents the order
in which events will be presented.  Depending on the state of the
<CODE>order</CODE> variable, this list will either remain sequential or be
randomized.

</P>
<P>
The epoch process is also responsible for determining when to update the
weights in the network, since this can usually be done either after each
event or at the end of the epoch (depending on the state of the
<CODE>wt_update</CODE> variable).  The epoch process itself calls the
<CODE>UpdateWeights</CODE> function on the network, even when it is doing
updates after each event.  Thus, lower-level processes should never call
this function themselves.

The following variables are on the <B>EpochProcess</B>:

</P>

<H2>12.5  Variables</H2>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Counter trial</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX940"></A>
The number of the current trial being executed.  This is the counter for
the epoch process.  It is automatically initialized to be the number of
events in the environment.
<DT><CODE>Event* cur_event</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX941"></A>
This is a pointer to the current event being processed. After each
trial, the EpochProcess updates this variable to point to the next event
based on its list of event indexes.  It gets the event from the
environment using the <CODE>GetEvent</CODE> function of the environment
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_136.html">11.1  Environments</A>).
<DT><CODE>Order order</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX942"></A>
Controls the order in which Events are presented to the network. The
values for this are:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>SEQUENTIAL</CODE>
<DD>
Present events in sequential order (i.e. in the order they currently are
in the Environment <CODE>events</CODE> group).
<DT><CODE>PERMUTED</CODE>
<DD>
Present events in permuted order.  This ensures that each event is only
presented once per epoch, but the order is randomized.
<DT><CODE>RANDOM</CODE>
<DD>
This picks an event at random (with replacement) from the list of
events.  This does not use the epoch process's list of events, and it
allows the same event to be presented multiple times in an epoch, while
other events might not be presented at all.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>WtUpdate wt_update</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX943"></A>
Determines when the network's weights are updated (if at all).  The
possible values are:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TEST</CODE>
<DD>
Don't update weights at all (for testing the network).  This also causes
the training process to not increment the epoch counter of the network
after each epoch, since the epoch counter is supposed to reflect the
extent of training experience the network has had.
<DT><CODE>ON_LINE</CODE>
<DD>
Update the weights on-line (after every event).
<DT><CODE>BATCH</CODE>
<DD>
Update the weights after every epoch (batch mode).
<DT><CODE>SMALL_BATCH</CODE>
<DD>
Update the weights after every <CODE>batch_n</CODE> events.  This allows an
intermediate level of batch mode learning which can be parameterized
independent of the number of events in the epoch. 
</DL>
<DT><CODE>int batch_n</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX944"></A>
Specifies the number of events between weight updates if
<CODE>wt_update</CODE> is <CODE>SMALL_BATCH</CODE>.
</DL>
