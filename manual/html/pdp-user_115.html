Layers are basically just groups of units, but they also constitute the
basic elements of connectivity as specified by the projections
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_116.html">10.3  Projections</A>).  Thus, one can specify that a whole group of units
should be connected in a particular fashion to another whole group of
units, instead of going one-by-one through the units and telling each
one individually how to connect to other units.  Note that the model
used in PDP++ is the <EM>receiver</EM> model -- a layer contains the
projections it <EM>receives</EM> from other layers, not the ones it sends
to them.

Further, in certain kinds of learning algorithms, particularly those
with a self-organizing character, the Layer plays a computational role
in that it implements competition among units, for example (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_229.html">16  Self-organizing Learning</A>).
In these algorithms, the <B>Layer</B> will have an accompanying
<B>LayerSpec</B> that contains the parameters governing the computation
that occurs in the layer.  However, in standard backpropagation and
constraint satisfaction algorithms (section <A HREF="pdp-user_197.html">14  Backpropagation</A>, section <A HREF="pdp-user_217.html">15  Constraint Satisfaction</A>), the LayerSpec
is not used.

Layers have the following variables:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>int n_units</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX585"></A>
Number of units to create with Build command.  Entering a value of 0
will cause the n_units to be computed based on the current geometry
(i.e., n_units = x * y).
<DT><CODE>Geometry geom</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX586"></A>
Specifies the layer's 3D geometry for its units. It is used for display
purposes, and for computing a default <CODE>n_units</CODE>.  Note that a
<CODE>z</CODE> value of greater than 1 means that multiple sub-groups of units
will be created in the layer, each of which having x * y units (by
default).
<DT><CODE>Geometry pos</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX587"></A>
Specifies the layer's 3D position relative to the network. Used for
display purposes and potentially for algorithms that depend on physical
distance information.
<DT><CODE>Geometry gp_geom</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX588"></A>
This is the geometry of the sub-groups of units within a layer (only
applicable if <CODE>geom.z &#62; 1</CODE>).  Groups will be arranged in the
x,y geometry given by this parameter (i.e.,  <CODE>x * y</CODE> should be &#62;=
<CODE>geom.z</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>Projection_Group projections</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX589"></A>
The group of projections which specify the connections that this layer
receives from other layers.
<DT><CODE>Unit_Group units</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX590"></A>
The group of units within the layer.  The type of units which are
created is determined by the <CODE>el_typ</CODE> on this group
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_93.html">8.2.2  Group Variables</A>).  Note that sub-groups of units can be
created, as given by the <CODE>geom.z</CODE> parameter, and as described
in greater detail below.
<DT><CODE>UnitSpec_SPtr unit_spec</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX591"></A>
The default unit specification for units created in this layer.  This is
applied whenever the Build function is performed.
<DT><CODE>bool lesion</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX592"></A>
When set to <CODE>true</CODE>, this layer is inactivated from all processing,
as if it was not there in the first place.  This makes it possible to
selectively pre-train certain layers within the network, for example.
<DT><CODE>Unit:ExtType ext_flag</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX593"></A>
Indicates which kind of external input the layer last received.
Whenever input is applied to the network from an environment, the
affected layer's flag is set, so that when it comes time to clear the
unit flags, or perform any other input-specific processing, only
relevant layers need to be processed.
</DL>

<P>
The following layer functions are available, either in the layer edit
dialog or in the CSS script language:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Build()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX594"></A>
Create <CODE>n_units</CODE> in the layer and arrange them according to the
<CODE>geometry</CODE>.   If units already exist, they are enforced to be of
the type of the unit group.  Thus, the best way to change the type of
units in the layer is to change the <CODE>el_typ</CODE> of the units group and
then do a Build() (see also section <A HREF="pdp-user_113.html">10.1  The Network Object</A>).
<DT><CODE>Connect()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX595"></A>
Actually creates the connections into each of the units in the layer
according to the projections on this layer.  Note that any existing
connections are removed before connecting.
<DT><CODE>RemoveCons()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX596"></A>
Removes any existing connections into units in the layer.
<DT><CODE>DisConnect()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX597"></A>
This removes all the projections (and connections) that this layer
receives from other layers, and all the projections that other layers
receive from this layer.  Thus, it is stronger than <CODE>RemoveCons</CODE> in
that it removes the projections as well as the connections.
<DT><CODE>Copy_Weights(Layer *)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX598"></A>
Copies the weights from the other layer including unit bias weights.
<DT><CODE>SetLayerSpec(LayerSpec *)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX599"></A>
Sets the layer specification for this layer to be the given one.
<DT><CODE>SetUnitSpec(UnitSpec *)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX600"></A>
Sets the unit specification of all units in the layer to be the given
one, and makes that the default unit spec for any new units that would
be created in the layer.
<DT><CODE>SetConSpec(ConSpec *)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX601"></A>
Sets the connection specification of all projections in the layer to be
the given one.
</DL>

<P>
Note that the layer also has instances of other functions that are
present on the network, such as <CODE>InitWtState</CODE> and <CODE>InitState</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX602"></A>
<A NAME="IDX603"></A>
The <B>Unit_Group</B> provides another level of organization between the
layer and the units within the layer.  This can be useful for cases
where different groups of units play specialized roles, but have
otherwise the same connectivity to other layers (which is what makes
them part of the same layer instead of being different layers).  This
level of organization has been used to implement independent sub-pools
of activation competition within a larger layer, for example.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX604"></A>
<A NAME="IDX605"></A>
<A NAME="IDX606"></A>
Unit groups are created as sub-groups within the <CODE>units</CODE> member of
the layer.  The <CODE>z</CODE> value of the layer's geometry specification
indicates how many groups to create, and each of them has <CODE>n_units</CODE>
units arranged in the <CODE>geom.x, geom.y</CODE> geometry as specified in the
layer.  However, once created, the unit groups can be individually
re-sized, and they have their own <CODE>n_units</CODE>, <CODE>geom</CODE>, and
<CODE>pos</CODE> variables.  To have a unit group always use the settings on
the layer, the <CODE>n_units</CODE> should be set to 0.
