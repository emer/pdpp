<H3><A HREF="ta_css_toc.html">5.3.2  Differences Between CSS and ANSI C</A></H3>

<P>
The design specification for CSS should be the same as ANSI C. However,
at the present time, some features have not been implemented, including:

</P>
<P>
The full functionality of <CODE>#define</CODE> pre-processor macros is not
supported.  At this point, things are either defined or undefined and
the <CODE>#ifdef</CODE> and <CODE>#ifndef</CODE> functions can be used to
selectively include or not different parts of code.

</P>
<P>
The promotion of types in arithmetic expressions is not standard.  In
CSS, the result of an expression is determined by the left-most (first)
value in the expression.  Thus, <CODE>20 / 3.0</CODE> would result in an
integer value of 6, whereas <CODE>20.0 / 3</CODE> gives a real value of
6.6667. 

</P>
<P>
The guarantee that only as much of a logical expression will be
evaluated as is necessary is not implemented in CSS.  Thus, something
like <SAMP>`if((a == NULL) || (a-&#62;memb == "whatever"))'</SAMP> will
(unfortunately) not work as it would in C, since the second expression
will be evaluated even when <CODE>a</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Initialization of multiple variables of the same type in the same
statement, is not supported, for example:
<PRE>  int var1 = 20, var2 = 10, var3 = 15;
</PRE>

<P>
and initialization of an array must occur after it has been declared
(see example below).

</P>
<P>
There are a limited number of primitive types in CSS, with the others
defined in C being equivalent to one of these basic CSS types (see
section <A HREF="ta_css_22.html">5.4.5  Basic Types in CSS</A>).  This is because everything in CSS is actually
represented by an object, so the storage-level differences between
many different C types are irrelevant in the script language.

</P>
<P>
Pointers in CSS are restricted to point to an object which lies in an
array somewhere, or is a single entity.  The pointer is "smart", and it
is impossible to increment a pointer that points to a single entity,
which makes all pointer arithmatic safe:

</P>
<PRE>css&#62; int xxx;
css&#62; int* xp = &#38;xxx;
css&#62; print xp
(Int)* xp --&#62; (Int) xxx = 0
css&#62; xp++;
Cannot modify a NULL or non-array pointer value
&#62;1      xp++;
css&#62; print *(xp +1);
Cannot modify a NULL or non-array pointer value
&#62;1      print *(xp +1);
</PRE>

<P>
but it is possible to increment and perform arithmetic on a pointer
when it points to an array:

</P>
<PRE>css&#62; int xar[10];
css&#62; xp = xar;
css&#62; xar = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
css&#62; print xar
(Int) xar[10] {
0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9 
}
css&#62; print xp
(Int)* xp --&#62; (Int) xar[10] {
0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9 
}
css&#62; print *(xp+2);
(Int)  = 2
css&#62; print *(xp+3);
(Int)  = 3
css&#62; xp++;
css&#62; print *(xp+3);
(Int)  = 4
css&#62; print *(xp+9);
Array bounds exceeded
&#62;1      p *(xp+9);
(void) Void
css&#62; print *(xp+8);
(Int)  = 9
</PRE>

<P>
The error that occurred when the <CODE>print *(xp+9)</CODE> command was issued
(after <CODE>xp</CODE> already points to <CODE>xar[1]</CODE>), illustrates the kind
of "smart pointers" that are built into CSS, which prevent crashes by
preventing access to the wrong memory areas.
