<H2><A NAME="IDX799" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">11.3  Representing Sequences of Events</A></H2>

<P>
Sequences of events are represented in PDP++ by creating subgroups
within the main <CODE>.events</CODE> group of an environment.  Each sub group
should contain a set of events that define one discrete sequence of
related events.  If the appropriate <B>SequenceEpoch</B> and <B>Sequence</B>
processes are used, they will access the <CODE>GroupCount</CODE> and
<CODE>GetGroup</CODE> functions on the environment (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_136.html">11.1  Environments</A>), which
will allow the epoch-level process to iterate over the groups
(sequences) in the environment, while the sequence process iterates over
the events within each group.  The sequence-based processes are
discussed in section <A HREF="pdp-user_162.html">12.6.1  Processes for Sequences of Events</A>.
