<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.2.3  Object Hierarchy: The Root Object and the Project</A></H3>

<P>
As a result of loading the "xor.proj" file, we created a number of
objects, all of which can be thought of as organized into a hierarchical
tree, with Root at the top of the tree.  The Root window is associated
with the Root object, which is a generic object that basically just
serves as a place holder for other objects.  We opened the XOR project
in Root, and so an object representing the entire XOR project has been
created as a child of Root.  The <B>Project</B> window is associated with
this project; in fact we could create a second project under root, and
if we did a second project window would be created.  Typically, though,
we just have one project.  Within this project, we have both a network
and an environment, as well as some other things we will consider later
in this tutorial.  Within the network we have layers of units; within
the units we have projections from other layers, which contain
connections.

</P>
<P>
Each object can be identified by a string that specifies its location in
the object hierarchy.  Root sits at the top of the object hierarchy; our
project is a 'child' of root.  It's identifier string is
<CODE>.projects[0]</CODE>.  In general, the identifier string for an object
specifies its location in the object hierarchy as a pathway
specification that begins with a '.', followed by fields separated by
dots.  Each field contains a type-name and an index.  One can trace the
pathway to a particular object down from Root (implicit in the first
dot) through intermediate fields separated by dots, ending with the
field specifying the type and token number of the object itself.  The
path for the project is short since it is the first (and only) project
that is a child of Root.  This is all exactly like a directory
hierarchy, except we have objects instead of files and the separator is
'.' instead of '/'.

</P>
<P>
Objects can have proper names as well as type names and indices; these
names can be used to access the object directly and to give it a
mnemonic label that can be used in referring to it.  The windows you see
give the full identifier string and if a name has been assigned, they
give the name as well in parentheses.

</P>
<P>
Within the Project window, we have several menus accessible.  As before,
one of these menus refers to the Project Object itself (the <I>Object</I>
menu).  The other menus refer to the children of the project,
which are again organized into several types.  The main ones we will
care about are the networks, the environments, the processes, and the
logs.  The defaults, specs, and scripts are for customizations that we
will not consider for the moment.  We could access the network through
the <I>.networks</I> menu, but we already have a window up on the screen
that gives us access to the network, called the <B>NetView</B>.
