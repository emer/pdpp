As discussed in section <A HREF="pdp-user_139.html">11.3  Representing Sequences of Events</A>, environments can be constructed that
specify sequences of events.  Certain algorithms can learn temporal
contingencies between events, so it is important to be able to present
the events in the proper sequence.  There are two specialized types of
schedule processes that handle the presentation of sequences of events
to the network, the <B>SequenceEpoch</B>, and the <B>SequenceProcess</B>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX965"></A>
The <B>SequenceEpoch</B> is a version of the epoch process
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_156.html">12.4.3  Iterating over Trials: EpochProcess</A>) which, instead of iterating over individual
events, iterates over <EM>groups</EM> of events.  Thus, this process uses
the <CODE>GroupCount()</CODE> and <CODE>GetGroup()</CODE> functions on the
environment instead of the event-wise ones (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_136.html">11.1  Environments</A>).  Each
group of events represents a collection of events that form a sequence.
The sequence epoch adds a <CODE>cur_event_gp</CODE> field, which contains a
pointer to the current event group that is being processed.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="pdp-user_157.html">12.5.0.1  Distributed Memory Computation in the EpochProcess</A> for how these processes operate under
distributed memory parallel processing.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>order</CODE> field on the sequence version of the epoch process now
refers to the order of presentation of the groups (sequences) of events,
and not the order of individual events within the sequences.  Also, the
<CODE>SMALL_BATCH</CODE> mode of <CODE>wt_update</CODE> in the sequence epoch 
can now take on one of two different possible meanings, depending on
the state of the <CODE>small_batch</CODE> field.  In <CODE>SEQUENCE</CODE> mode,
it means that weight changes are applied after <CODE>batch_n</CODE>
sequences are processed.  In <CODE>EVENT</CODE> mode, it means that weight
changes are applied after every <CODE>batch_n</CODE> events within the
sequence (as in a standard EpochProcess).  Also, an additional weight
update is performed at the end of the sequence in this mode to ensure
that the weights are always updated at sequence boundaries, because
the batch_n counter starts over at the start of each sequence.

</P>
<P>
The <B>SequenceProcess</B> is typically created as a child of the
<B>SequenceEpoch</B>, and it is the one that iterates over the particular
events within a given group or sequence.  It obtains the current group
of events from its parent sequence epoch process, and iterates over
them.  It can control the order of presentation of events within the
sequence, and has options for initializing the activation state of the
network at the start of the sequence:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Counter tick</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX966"></A>
Each presentation of an event within a sequence is called a "tick", and
this member counts the number of ticks that have gone by.  The
<CODE>max</CODE> for this counter is automatically set to be the number of
events in the current sequence.
<DT><CODE>Event* cur_event</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX967"></A>
This is a pointer to the current event being processed.
<DT><CODE>Event_MGroup* cur_event_gp</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX968"></A>
This is a pointer to the current event group (sequence) being processed.
It is obtained from the parent <B>SequenceEpoch</B>.
<DT><CODE>Order order</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX969"></A>
This determines the order of presentation of the events within a
sequence.  While sequences are usually presented in <CODE>SEQUENTIAL</CODE>
order, it is conceivable that one might want <CODE>PERMUTED</CODE> or
<CODE>RANDOM</CODE> orders as well, which are available (these work just like
the equivalent in the epoch process, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_156.html">12.4.3  Iterating over Trials: EpochProcess</A>).
<DT><CODE>StateInit sequence_init</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX970"></A>
This determines if and how the activation state of the network is
initialized at the start of the sequence.  <CODE>DO_NOTHING</CODE> means that
no initialization is done, <CODE>INIT_STATE</CODE> means that the
<CODE>InitState</CODE> function is called, and <CODE>MODIFY_STATE</CODE> means that
the <CODE>ModifyState</CODE> function is called, which allows for
algorithm-specific ways of changing state between sequences (e.g.
decaying the activations).
