<H2><A NAME="IDX835" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">11.8  Environment Generation Functions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX836"></A>

</P>
<P>
The following functions are available on the <B>Environment</B> object (in
the <I>Generate</I> menu) for algorithmically creating events.  See
<TT>`demo/bp_misc/gen_rnd_prototypes.css'</TT> for a CSS script that creates
prototypes and random exemplars based on these prototypes using some of
the following functions.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ReplicateEvents(int n_replicas, bool make_groups)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX837"></A>
This will create n_replicas of all of the existing events in the
environment.  If make_groups is set, then all events which are replicas
of a given one will be placed into the same sub-group.   Otherwise, the
replicas appear right after the event they are replicas of.  This can
be used to replicate a set of prototype events, and noise can be added
(AddNoise, FlipBits) to create random distortions of these prototypes.
<DT><CODE>PermutedBinary(int pat_no, int n_on)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX838"></A>
This produces random (permuted) binary patterns of 1's and 0's over the
existing events in the environment.  <CODE>pat_no</CODE> determines which
pattern to use, and <CODE>n_on</CODE> specifies the number of 1's in each
random pattern.
<DT><CODE>PermutedBinary_MinDist(int pat_no, int n_on, float dist, bool max_correl)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX839"></A>
This is like PermutedBinary, but it ensures that the hamming distance
between any two patterns is at least <CODE>dist</CODE> (i.e., all patterns are
separated by at least this minimum distance).  If max_correl is set,
this ensures that the maximum correlation between patterns is below the
<CODE>dist</CODE> value.
<DT><CODE>FlipBits(int pat_no, int n_off, int n_on)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX840"></A>
This switches exactly <CODE>n_off</CODE> values of a pattern from 1 to 0, and
<CODE>n_on</CODE> from 0 to 1.  In other words, some values that were 1 will
now be 0, and some values that were 0 will now be 1.  This is a useful
way of creating random distortions of prototypical patterns.
<DT><CODE>FlipBits_MinMax(int pat_no, int n_off, int n_on, float min_dist, float max_dist, metric, norm, tol)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX841"></A>
This does FlipBits, but if the new event that was just flipped is
outside the distance limits set by min_ and max_dist, according to the
metric supplied, then another pattern is tried.  There is a timeout and
an error message will be reported if it takes too many retries to fit
these criteria.
<DT><CODE>Clear(int pat_no)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX842"></A>
Simply clears out the pattern values to a specified value (e.g., zero).
<DT><CODE>AddNoise(int pat_no, Random rnd_spec)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX843"></A>
This will add noise of the given specification to all events in pattern
<CODE>pat_no</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>TransformPats(int pat_no, PreProcessVals trans)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX844"></A>
This will apply given transformation (simple math) operation to all
events in pattern <CODE>pat_no</CODE>.
