The <B>TrainProcess</B> iterates over epochs of training a network.  It
typically has an <B>EpochProcess</B> as its <CODE>sub_proc</CODE>.  When this
process is initialized (e.g. by <CODE>ReInit</CODE> or <CODE>NewInit</CODE>), it
also initializes the weights of the network.  It has an <CODE>epoch</CODE>
counter which is tied to the <CODE>epoch</CODE> counter on the network object,
which this process increments after every epoch of training.  Note that
if the epoch process under this training process is in <CODE>TEST</CODE> mode,
then neither epoch counter is incremented.

There is an alternative kind of process which also iterates over epochs,
called the <B>NEpochProcess</B>, which differs from the <B>TrainProcess</B> in
that it does not initialize the network when it is initialized.  Also,
it keeps its own <CODE>epoch</CODE> counter separate from that of the network.
Thus, while it will increment the network's counter during training (but
not turing testing), it <EM>will</EM> increment its epoch counter even
during testing.  Thus, it is useful for cases where you need to run
multiple epochs of testing (e.g., to get multiple samples from settling
in a stochastic network).
