Another way in which the PDP++ software has built-in flexibility is in
the ability to create substructure at any level.  By substructure, we
mean the grouping of objects together in ways that reflect additional
structure not captured in the basic structural distinctions made in the
software (e.g., as described in the previous sections).  For example, it
is possible to group events together to reflect sequential information.
Also, one can imagine that certain layers should be grouped together to
reflect the fact that they all perform a similar function, and should be
treated as a group. Similarly, units within a layer can be divided into
subgroups that might reflect different parameter settings, etc.

</P>
<P>
The basic operations of the software are written so as to be insensitive
to this additional substructure (i.e., they can "flatten out" the
groups), which allows the substructure to be used without requiring
special-case code to handle it.

</P>
<P>
Substructure is defined by creating subgroups of objects.  Thus,
everywhere the user has the opportunity to create an object of a given
type, they also have the opportunity to create a subgroup of such
objects.
