The <B>SettleProcess</B> is a base type of process that is used to iterate
over cycles of activation updating.  Thus, it typically has a
<B>CycleProcess</B> as its sub-process.  In algorithms with recurrent
connectivity, it is typically necessary to iteratively update the
activation states of the units for some number of cycles.  This process
controls this settling procedure.  Particular algorithms will derive
their own version of the settle process.

The <CODE>cycle</CODE> counter records the number of cycles of updating that
have been performed.  Setting the <CODE>max</CODE> for this counter will limit
settling to this number of cycles.  In addition, some algorithms use a
<CODE>loop_stat</CODE> that measures the change in activation.   When this
stat goes below its criterion threshold, the settle process will stop.
Thus, the stat determines when the settling has reached an equilibrium
state.
