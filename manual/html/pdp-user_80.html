<H3><A NAME="IDX212" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">7.4.5  Basic Types in CSS</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>

<P>
There are six basic "primitive" types in CSS: <CODE>Int</CODE>, <CODE>Real</CODE>,
<CODE>char</CODE>, <CODE>String</CODE>, <CODE>bool</CODE>, and <CODE>enum</CODE>.  An <CODE>Int</CODE>
is essentially an <CODE>int</CODE>, a <CODE>Real</CODE> is essentially a
<CODE>double</CODE>, and a <CODE>String</CODE> is a C++, dynamically-allocating
string object.  A <CODE>char</CODE> is just an int object that will convert
into its equivalen ASCII character instead of its numerical value when
converted into a String.  A <CODE>bool</CODE> has two values: <CODE>true</CODE> and
<CODE>false</CODE>.  An <CODE>enum</CODE> has defined enumeration values, and will
convert a string representation of one of those values into the
corresponding symbolic/numeric value.

</P>
<P>
All of the other flavors of <CODE>int</CODE> in C, including <CODE>short</CODE>,
<CODE>long</CODE>, <CODE>unsigned</CODE>, etc, are all just defined to be the same
as an <CODE>Int</CODE>.  Similarly, a <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>double</CODE> are
defined to be the same as a <CODE>Real</CODE>.  The <CODE>String</CODE> object is
the same as the one that comes with the GNU libg++ library (slightly
modified), which provides all of the common string manipulation
functions as member functions of the <CODE>String</CODE> object, and handles
the allocation of memory for the string dynamically, etc.

</P>
<P>
In addition to the primitive types, there are reference, pointer, and
array types.  Also, there are both script-defined and TypeAccess-derived
hard-coded <CODE>class</CODE> objects.  Finally, there are types that point to
hard-coded members of class objects, which correspond to all of the
basic C types, and, unlike the basic script types, are sensitive to the
actual size of a <CODE>short</CODE> vs a <CODE>long</CODE>, etc.

</P>
<P>
Finally there is a special <CODE>SubShell</CODE> type, which allows one to
have multiple compile spaces (cssProgSpace's) within css.  Thus, one
could <CODE>load</CODE> one program into the current shell, and use a SubShell
to load another one without getting rid of the first.  The two shells
can communicate via <CODE>extern</CODE> objects, and they share the same type
space.  Typical usage is:

</P>
<PRE>css&#62; extern SubShell sub_shell;
css&#62; chsh sub_shell
</PRE>

<P>
The first line defines the object (<CODE>extern</CODE> is recommended else it
will be removed when the parent shell is recompiled), and the second
switches to it.  To exit from the sub shell, just use <CODE>exit</CODE> or
<KBD>ctrl-D</KBD> (and have faith that when you answer 'y' you will be
returned to the parent shell).
