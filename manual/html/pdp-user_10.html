In order to make the scheduling aspect of the software reasonably
flexible, it has itself been decomposed into a set of different object
types.  Each of these object types plays a specific role within the
overall task of scheduling the training and testing of a network.

</P>
<P>
The backbone of the scheduling function is made up of a structure
hierarchy of objects of the type <CODE>SchedProcess</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_150.html">12.2  The Schedule Process (SchedProcess)</A>), which reflects the hierarchy of the different time
grains of processing in a neural network:

</P>
<PRE>Training (loop over epochs)
    Epoch (loop over trials)
        Trial (present a single pattern)
        .
        .
    .
    .
</PRE>

<P>
Thus, there is one object for every grain of processing, and each
process essentially just loops over the next-finer grain of processing
in the hierarchy.  Because each grain of processing is controlled by a
separate process, it is possible to alter both the parameters and type
of processing that takes place at each grain <EM>independently</EM>.  This
is why this design results in great flexibility.

</P>
<P>
Since this time grain structure forms the backbone of scheduling, all
other aspects of scheduling, and anything that depends on time grain
information in any way, are oriented around it.  For example, setting
the training criteria becomes embedded in the Training level of
processing.  The updating of displays is associated with a particular
time grain of processing (e.g., telling the system that you want to see
the activations updated in your view of a network after every trial
means associating the view with the Trial grain of processing).
Similarly, the generation of information to be logged, and the update of
the display of this information, is tied to a particular time grain.

</P>
<P>
The other principal type of object used for scheduling is the
<EM>statistic</EM> (of type <CODE>Stat</CODE>, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_167.html">12.7  The Statistic Process</A>), which is
responsible for computing (or simply recording) data of any kind that is
either relevant for controlling scheduling (e.g., stopping criteria), or
is to be displayed in a log at a particular time grain.  Thus,
statistics are the source of any data that is to be logged, and provide
a general way of specifying when to stop processing based on the values
of computed variables (i.e., sum-squared error).  Again, because these
statistic objects can be mixed and matched with all sorts of different
schedule processes, this creates a high level of flexibility.

</P>
<P>
Because they are intimately tied to the time grain of processing, and
can directly affect its course, statistics actually "live" on schedule
processes.  Thus, whenever a statistic is created, it is created in a
particular process that governs a given time grain of processing.
Furthermore, statistics can create copies of themselves that reflect
their <EM>aggregation</EM> over higher levels of processing.  For example,
the sum-squared error statistic (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_172.html">12.8.1  Summed-Error Statistics</A>) is created at
the Trial level of processing, where it can actually compute the
difference between the output and target for a given pattern right after
it has been presented.  However, in order for these individual
pattern-level sse values to be accumulated or aggregated over time,
there is another sse statistic at the Epoch level of processing whose
only job is to add up the Trial level sse values.
