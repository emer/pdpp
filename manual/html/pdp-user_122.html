The <B>UniformRandomPrjnSpec</B> specifies a uniform random pattern of
connectivity.

<A NAME="IDX642"></A>
<A NAME="IDX643"></A>
<CODE>p_con</CODE> specifies the overall probability of connectivity -- a
connection is made with a given sending unit with this probability.  The
<CODE>permute</CODE> flag indicates that a randomly-ordered list of sending
units is created, and p_con * n_units are selected for connecting ---
creates exactly the same number of connections per receiving unit.
<CODE>same_seed</CODE> specifies that this projection saves the random seed
used for creating connections, so tht the pattern is the same every time
(useful for being able to read in weight files for randomly connected
networks).

<A NAME="IDX644"></A>
The <B>PolarRndPrjnSpec</B> creates randomized patterns of connectivity as
a function of distance and angle between sending and receiving unit.
Distance and angle are computed from the center of a receiving unit's
receptive field in the sending layer, which, as with the
<B>TesselPrjnSpec</B> described above, can be computed in different ways.
Two different random functions control the distribution of connectivity
in distance and angle.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX645"></A>
The <CODE>dist_type</CODE> field controls how the distance is computed, as
follows:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>XY_DIST</CODE>
<DD>
Just a simple distance function using the receiver's coordinates in the
sending layer.  This works fine when both layers are the same size.
<DT><CODE>XY_DIST_CENTER</CODE>
<DD>
The receiver's coordinates are transformed relative to the center of the
sending layer.  This makes the distance distribution symmetrical.
<DT><CODE>XY_DIST_NORM</CODE>
<DD>
The receiver's coordinates are normalized by the total size of the
sending layer.
<DT><CODE>XY_DIST_CENTER_NORM</CODE>
<DD>
The receiver's coordinates are normalized by the total size of the
sending layer, and are computed relative to the center of the layer.
This will result in a reasonable distance measure even when the two
layers are of different sizes.

The <CODE>rnd_dist</CODE> and <CODE>rnd_angle</CODE> are <B>Random</B>
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_101.html">8.5  Random Distributions</A>) classes that specify the distributions and
associated parameters for connection distance and angle from the
receiving unit.  Distance is scaled as above, and angle is done on a 0-1
scale (i.e., the random number is multiplied by 2pi).  <CODE>p_con</CODE>
determines how many connections are made.  A target value of p_con *
n_units in the sending layer is used, and connections are attempted,
rejecting attempts to reconnect to an existing connection, until
<CODE>max_retries</CODE> such rejections have been made.  Thus, for very tight
distributions, the same units will be selected again and again, and it
may be impossible for <CODE>p_con</CODE> different connections to be
established.  In this case, a warning message is issued.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX650"></A>
The <CODE>wrap</CODE> flag determines if the units are treated as one big
wrapping-around surface, or if it is clipped at the edges of the layer.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX651"></A>
<CODE>same_seed</CODE> functions as on the UniformRandomPrjnSpec
