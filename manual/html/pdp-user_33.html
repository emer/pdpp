<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.3.1  Recording a Script File of Your Actions</A></H3>

<P>
If you would like to make a script file of your actions, you should
start it up before you start building the network.  The script will
record all your actions, which means you can later look at this script
and see what steps you took (and replay them).  However, because one
inevitably makes mistakes along the way, using a script to save
everything is not the best idea -- instead, we simply save a project
file at the end with everything stored as it is currently configured.

</P>
<P>
To start recording your script, select <I>.scripts</I> / <I>New</I> /
<I>Script</I> , and <I>Ok</I> the creation with the <EM>right</EM> mouse button
(this tells the program you want to edit the object that you create).
An edit dialog window for the script object should automatically
appear. If you forgot to use the right mouse button, you can manually
bring up an edit dialog by choosing <I>.scripts</I> / <I>Edit</I> /
<I>Script_0</I>. You will want to associate a file with this script, so
click on the menu next to <CODE>script file</CODE> (where it says <CODE>--- No
File ---</CODE>) and select <I>Open</I>. A File Selection Window will appear with
an empty edit field near at the top under the text "Enter Filename:".
Fill in the name you want to give your script ("my424" would do) and
press the "Open" button at the bottom of the File Selection Window or
press &#60;Enter&#62;.  Once this is done you still have to click <I>Apply</I> back
on the script dialog to confirm your file name.  Now hit <I>Record</I> and
your future actions will be recorded in the script.  The mouse pointer
should change to an arrrow with the letters "REC" beneath it to indicate
that you are in record mode. To stop recording you can press the
<I>StopRec</I> button in this window. Since we do not need this window
until later you can iconify it now.
