The <B>OneToOnePrjnSpec</B> simply connects units in a one-to-one fashion.
This is typically for the entire set of units, but can be controlled by
setting the <CODE>n_conns</CODE>, <CODE>recv_start</CODE> and <CODE>send_start</CODE>
parameters, which specify the total number of connections to make and
starting offsets.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX660"></A>
The <B>SymmetricPrjnSpec</B> makes receiving connections to units in the
sending layer that are already receiving connections from units in the
receiving layer.  Thus, it makes symmetric connectivity where another
projection spec has defined the pattern from the other set of units.
Note that the other projection spec must be associated with a layer that
comes before the one this spec is on, otherwise it will not have any
connections to copy from.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX661"></A>
The <B>ScriptPrjnSpec</B> uses a CSS script to create the connections.  It
contains an <CODE>s_args</CODE> array of Strings which are passed to script as
arguments (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_64.html">7  Guide to the Script Language (CSS)</A>).  Any arbitrary form of connectivity can be
described by writing the appropriate script.  Several useful functions
on the unit are available for making connections, including
<CODE>ConnectFrom</CODE>, which takes the sending unit and the projection as
arguments, and returns the connection and the two connection groups
associated with it.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX662"></A>
The <B>CustomPrjnSpec</B> is used when the connectivity
between units is hand assembled. Thus it does not specify a connectivity
function, and therefore performs no actions when the Build command is
called on a Network.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX663"></A>
<A NAME="IDX664"></A>
The <B>LinkPrjnSpec</B> does not create any connections itself.  Instead,
it turns existing connections into linked connections.  The connections
to be linked are specified by the layer name and unit index for both the
sending and receiving units.  The connection function then finds the
connection that connects these two units, and links it in with the other
ones.  The first connection specified is the "owner" of the connection,
and its weight values are the ones that are used.  The <CODE>links</CODE>
member is the list of connections to be linked together.  This type of
projection spec, since it does not create any projections itself, is
typically assigned to a "dummy" self projection on one of the affected
layers.
