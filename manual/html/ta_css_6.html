<H1><A HREF="ta_css_toc.html">5  Guide to the Script Language (CSS)</A></H1>

<P>
CSS is the script language for the PDP++ software.  It is a
general-purpose language that allows one to do virtually anything that
could be done by writing programs in C or C++ and compiling them.  It
provides full access to all the types and objects defined in PDP++, and
allows you to call the "member functions" of these objects and set the
values of their members variables.

</P>
<P>
There are two principal uses for the script language in running
simulations.  One is to automate the procedure of setting up and running
a simulation.  In this role, the script replaces commands that would
otherwise be given through the graphical user interface (gui).  The
other is to extend the software without having to re-compile and
re-link.  Thus, one can write new kinds of procedures, statistics, etc.
that are particular to a given simulation in the script language, and
run them as if they were hard coded.  This gives the PDP++ software more 
flexibility.
