<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.3.3  Making a New Environment</A></H3>

<P>
Now we can create the <B>Environment</B> and the training patterns.  Locate
the Project window (which you'll note has been updated to reflect the
existence of your new Network object), and select <I>.environments</I> /
<I>New</I> / <I>Environment</I> and <I>Ok</I>.  Your <B>EnviroView</B> window will
appear.  Then click <I>New Event</I>.  Set the number to create to 4, then
click <I>Ok</I>.  You should see Panel buttons for all four events
("Event_0".."Event_3").  Left-click the first one to select it for
viewing, then extend-select (middle-click or Shift + left-click) the
rest in order, and all of them will appear to the right of the buttons.
They automatically have an input pattern the same size as the input
layer and an output or target pattern the same size as the output layer,
and all the values of all of the patterns are initialized to 0.  Both
input and output patterns are displayed with the top four boxes of each
event represent the output target values and the lower four boxes
representing the input values. You can now set the 1 bits of each
pattern by clicking on the color spot next to the value field labeled
'1', then clicking on the appropriate elements of the pattern.  They
will turn to the appropriate color, indicating the specified value.  You
have to click <I>Apply</I> for the change to take effect.  Now you have
your environment.

</P>
<P>
You can also use this <B>EnviroView</B> window to configure the layout of
the patterns within the events according to the <B>EventSpec</B> and
<B>PatternSpec</B> specs.  The default layout (which works for our
present purposes) is to have one pattern for the first layer in the
network, which serves as an input, and another pattern for the last
layer in the network, which serves as an output.  However, these
defaults will not always be appropriate.  To see how to change them, hit
the <I>Edit Specs</I> button at the top left of the window, and then after
the display changes, hit the <I>EventSpec_0</I> button.  You will see two
grids for the two patterns (input and output).  You can move, reshape,
and edit these patterns if you need to.  The text within each pattern
shows some of the critical settings in terms of whether an pattern is an
<CODE>INPUT</CODE> or <CODE>TARGET</CODE>, what layer it goes to, etc.  We'll just
leave everything as-is for now, but if for example you wanted to change
the network to be a 8-3-8 encoder, then you'd need to reshape these
patterns to be 8 units wide instead of 4.  Doing so would automatically
stretch the corresponding events that use this spec.

</P>
<P>
For now, just hit <I>Edit Events</I> to return to the events display, and
iconify the window.
