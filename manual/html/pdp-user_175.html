The <B>CompareStat</B> provides a general way of comparing the results of
different statistics with each other.  Thus, one can actually use
statistics to analyze one's data on-line, instead of dumping it all to a
file and analyzing it after the fact.

</P>
<P>
Similarly, the <B>ComputeStat</B> provides a general way of performing
simple math computations on the results of other stat computations.  It
can be used on one stat (e.g., for thresholding, absolute-value or other
single-argument operations), or on two stats (e.g., for multiplying,
subtracting, etc between two stats).

</P>
<P>
The compare stat contains pointers to two other stats, <CODE>stat_1</CODE> and
<CODE>stat_2</CODE>, which provide the data to compare.  The data consists of
any stat val data that can be found on these stats.  Ideally, they both
have the same number of data values, typically in their <CODE>copy_vals</CODE>
group (e.g., from <B>MonitorStat</B>s that are <CODE>COPY</CODE>ing activations
from two sets of units that are being compared).

</P>
<P>
The types of comparisons are simply different distance functions that
measure the distances between the two stat's data:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CompareType cmp_type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1064"></A>
This is the type of distance function to use in making the comparison:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>SUM_SQUARES</CODE>
<DD>
sum of squares distance: sum[(x-y)^2]
<DT><CODE>EUCLIDIAN</CODE>
<DD>
euclidean distance: sqrt(sum[(x-y)^2])
<DT><CODE>HAMMING_DIST</CODE>
<DD>
hamming distance: sum[abs(x-y)]
<DT><CODE>COVAR</CODE>
<DD>
covariance: sum[(x-&#60;x&#62;)(y-&#60;y&#62;)]
<DT><CODE>CORREL</CODE>
<DD>
correlation: sum[(x-&#60;x&#62;)(y-&#60;y&#62;)] / sqrt(sum[x^2 y^2])
<DT><CODE>INNER_PROD</CODE>
<DD>
inner product: sum[x y]
<DT><CODE>CROSS_ENTROPY</CODE>
<DD>
cross entropy: sum[x ln(x/y) + (1-x)ln((1-x)/(1-y))]
</DL>
<DT><CODE>float dist_tol</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1065"></A>
This is a tolerance value for distance comparisons, where absolute
differences below this amount result in a 0 distance component.
<DT><CODE>bool norm</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1066"></A>
If this flag is checked, and one of the distance comparisons is being
performed, the values participating in the distance computation will be
normalized to a zero-one range prior to computation.  If the
<CODE>INNER_PROD</CODE> is being taken, this will result in a normalized
inner-product measure (dividing by the magnitudes of the individual
weight vectors).
<DT><CODE>SimpleMathSpec pre_proc_1,2,3</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1067"></A>
These allow for three steps of pre-processing on the values before they
are compared.  These members specify an operation and, optionally,
arguements to that operation in the <CODE>arg</CODE> member.  Note that the
thresholding function <CODE>THRESH</CODE> compares the value to the
<CODE>arg</CODE>, and gives a result of <CODE>hi</CODE> if it is
greater-than-or-equal, and <CODE>lo</CODE> if it is less-than the arg.
</DL>

<P>
The <B>ComputeStat</B> is like the compare stat, except that instead of
computing the distance, the <CODE>compute_1,2,3</CODE> math operators are
applied on the stats, and the result is aggregated according to
<CODE>net_agg</CODE>.  Pre-processing of each stat independently is supported
as with the compare stat.  To compute something between two stats (e.g.,
subtract values), then you just set the compute_1 operator <CODE>opr</CODE> to
<CODE>SUB</CODE>, and stat_2 values are subtracted from stat_1 values, with
the result going into stat_1.  Subsequent compute_ operators can then
manipulate this result (e.g, doing the <CODE>SQUARE</CODE>).  Note that they
don't all have to involve both stats, and you can only use one stat (in
which case compute_x just works like pre_proc_x).
