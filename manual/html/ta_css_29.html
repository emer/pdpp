<H2><A NAME="IDX181" HREF="ta_css_toc.html">6.1  Makefiles and Directory Organization</A></H2>

<P>
The PDP++ code should be installed in <TT>`/usr/local/pdp++'</TT>, or some
such similar place.  This path will be referred to from here on out as
PDPDIR.  This directory contains a set of sub-directories,
like <TT>`demo'</TT> and <TT>`manual'</TT>, etc. which contain different pieces
of the distribution.  See section <A HREF="ta_css_5.html">4.7  Installing the Programmers Version</A> for instructions on how to
install and compile the source distribution of the PDP++ software.  In
order compile your own additions to the software, you must install and
compile the source code distribution!

</P>
<P>
The critical directories from a programmer's perspective are the
<TT>`src'</TT>, which contains the source code, <TT>`config'</TT>, which
contains the Makefile configuration stuff, <TT>`include'</TT> which has
links to the header files, and <TT>`lib'</TT> which has links to the various
libraries.

</P>
<P>
Each sub-directory within the <TT>`src'</TT> directory contains code
relevant to some sub-component of the PDP++ software.  These directories
are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`ta_string'</TT>
<DD>
The basic String class used throughout the software.  It is a
slightly modified version of the GNU String class that is distributed
with the libg++ distribution (version 2.6.2).
<DT><TT>`iv_misc'</TT>
<DD>
Contains a number of extra pieces of code that supplement the
InterViews GUI toolkit.
<DT><TT>`ta'</TT>
<DD>
Contains the TypeAccess system, which gives classes the ability to
know all about themselves and other classes at run time.  The use of
this software is what makes the largely automatic interface used in
PDP++ possible.  It is described further in section <A HREF="ta_css_30.html">6.2  The TypeAccess System</A>.  This
directory also contains a lot of basic objects, like <B>Array</B>
(section <A HREF="ta_css_73.html">8.3  Arrays</A>), <B>List</B> and <B>Group</B> (section <A HREF="ta_css_68.html">8.2  Groups</A>) objects.
<DT><TT>`css'</TT>
<DD>
Contains the code for the CSS script language (see section <A HREF="ta_css_6.html">5  Guide to the Script Language (CSS)</A>).
<DT><TT>`iv_graphic'</TT>
<DD>
Contains a set of objects which implement a graphical object
manipulation environment that is used in the network viewer
(@xref{net-view}) and the graph log (@xref{log-views-graph}).
<DT><TT>`ta_misc'</TT>
<DD>
Contains a smorgasbord of various objects that might have
general applicability, and are not specifically PDP objects.
<DT><TT>`pdp'</TT>
<DD>
Where all of the specific pdp code is.
<DT><TT>`bp'</TT>
<DD>
Implements bp and rbp.
<DT><TT>`cs'</TT>
<DD>
Implements cs.
<DT><TT>`so'</TT>
<DD>
Implements so.
<DT><TT>`bpso'</TT>
<DD>
Implements the combined bp and so executable (just links the libraries).
<DT><TT>`leabra'</TT>
<DD>
Implements the leabra algorithm.
</DL>

<P>
Each directory has a set of include files which can be accessed as
&#60;xxx/yyy.h&#62;, where xxx is one of the directory names given above.  In
addition, each directory has its own library, which is just
<TT>`libxxx.a'</TT>, where xxx is the name of the directory (without any
underbars).  The bp, cs and so directories have a library name of
libpdp_xx.a, to indicate that they are part of the pdp software.

</P>
<P>
All of the compilation results (e.g. object files) go in a subdirectory
named after the CPU type being used.  The user must set the CPU
environmental variable appropriately, as per the definitions used in the
InterViews system.  The ones that everything has been tested and
compiled on are listed in the installation guide (see section <A HREF="ta_css_3.html">4  Installation Guide</A>), and the
INSTALL file.

</P>
<P>
Other possibilities are listed in section <A HREF="ta_css_5.html">4.7  Installing the Programmers Version</A>.  This should be the
same as when the system was first installed.

</P>
<P>
The include files and library are made in two stages.  The first stage
involves compiling the object files into the CPU subdirectory.  Then, if
everything goes ok, the library is made, which is then copied into a
further subdirectory of the CPU subdirectory called <TT>`lib_include'</TT>.
Also, all of the header files are compared with those already in the
<TT>`lib_include'</TT> subdirectory (if any), and those ones that are
different are copied over.  It is these header files in
<TT>`lib_include'</TT> that the <TT>`PDPDIR/include'</TT> directory makes links
to, and thus these are the ones that are included by other programs.
This setup allows one to test out a set of code by making an executable
in a given directory and getting things working before installing the
new header files and library for the rest of the system to use.

</P>
<P>
In order to add functionality to the software, one needs to create a new
directory, and then include various files from the above directories,
and link in their respective libraries.  This directory can be located
in the same master directory as the main distribution, or it can be
located in your own home directory somewhere.  This latter option is the
preferred one.

</P>
<P>
We have developed a shell file that does all of the things necessary to
create your own directory.  The first step is to make a master directory
off of your home directory, typically called <TT>`pdp++'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Then, run the <TT>`PDPDIR/bin/mknewpdp'</TT> command from this new
<TT>`home/pdp++'</TT> directory with an argument which is the name of the
directory/executable that you want to make.  This will give you
step-by-step instructions.  In the end, you will end up with a directory
that contains some sample code in the form of a .h and .cc file with the
same name as the directory.

</P>
<P>
The script will have installed a <TT>`Makefile'</TT> in your directory which
is the same as the one's found in the main PDP++ directories.  These
makefiles are constructed by concatenating together a bunch of pieces
of makefiles, some of which contain standard make actions, and others
which contain specific defaults for particular machines.  All of the
pieces are found in the <TT>`PDPDIR/config'</TT> directory.

</P>
<P>
The makefiles named <TT>`Makefile.CPU.[CC|g++]'</TT> are the
machine-specific files that you should edit to make sure they have all
the right settings for your system.  This should have been done already
during the installation of the PDP++ source code distribution, see
section <A HREF="ta_css_5.html">4.7  Installing the Programmers Version</A> for details.  

</P>
<P>
To these pieces is added the specific list of files that need to be made
in your directory. This is specified in the <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT> file.
This is the only makefile you should edit. It can be used to override
any of the settings in the standard makefiles, simply by redefining
definitions or actions.  If you add files to your directory, follow the
example for the one already in your default <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT> that was
installed with the <TT>`mknewpdp'</TT> command.

</P>
<P>
Note that there are a couple of compiler-specific "extra" files in the
directory.  These have the name of the directory plus a <TT>`_vt.cc'</TT> or
<TT>`_it.cc'</TT> suffix.  The <TT>`_vt'</TT> file is for virtual table
instantiation, which is controlled in cfront with the +e0/+e1 arguments.
It simply includes most of the header files in the software.  We have
found that by compiling everything except the <TT>`_vt'</TT> file with +e0
that the executables are much smaller.  This is even true in cfront
versions where they had "fixed" this problem.  You can try doing the
other way by leaving out the +e args and not using the <TT>`_vt'</TT> file
(see the definitions in <TT>`PDPDIR/config/Makefile.defs'</TT> for how to do
this: change your <TT>`Makefile.CPU'</TT> file and recompile the entire
distribution first..).

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`_ti.cc'</TT> is the template instantiation file needed by gnu g++
version 2.6.3 (reportedly, it won't be needed in 2.7).  It contains
explicit instantiations of all of the templates used in each library.
For user directories, this probably isn't needed, but its there if you
do declare any templates and encounter link problems with g++.  Also,
the <TT>`Makefile.CPU.g++'</TT> show how this file gets included in the
making of a given project.

</P>
<P>
<B>New for 2.0:</B> All of the makefile actions, as shown below, are now
available using a consistent syntax structure: all lower case, with
underbars separating different words.  This makes it much easier to
remember what command to type.  The old eclectic combinations of upper
and lower case words, etc are still available if you already know them.

</P>
<P>
The commonly-used actions that are defined in the makefile are as
follows:
<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`make bin, make opt_bin, make dbg_bin'</SAMP>
<DD>
Makes the binary from the files in this directory. Bin makes the default
form specified in the make file, while opt and dbg make optimized and
debug versions, respectively.
<DT><SAMP>`make re_bin, make opt_re_bin, make dbg_re_bin'</SAMP>
<DD>
Same as above, except it first removes the executable before making.
This is useful if a library has changed but no header files from that
library were changed.
<DT><SAMP>`make lib, make opt_lib, make dbg_lib'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like the above, except it makes a library containing the relevant .o
files.
<DT><SAMP>`make new_makefile'</SAMP>
<DD>
This makes a new version of the <TT>`Makefile'</TT> file in the current
directory.  This concatenates all of the different parts that together
make up a single <TT>`Makefile'</TT>.  However, it does not make a
<CODE>CPU</CODE> directory, which is necessary to actually compile (see
<CODE>cpu_dir</CODE> next).
<DT><SAMP>`make cpu_dir, make local_cpu_dir'</SAMP>
<DD>
This makes and configures a directory with the same name as the
<CODE>CPU</CODE> environmental variable (reflecting the CPU type of the
machine) suitable for compiling the object files into.  If
<CODE>local_cpu_dir</CODE> is made first, then this directory is actually a
symbolic link to a directory created on a disk local to the current
machine, so that compilation will be faster than if the directory where
the source is located is a networked (slow) directory (i.e., NFS).  The
<CODE>cpu_dir</CODE> action copies the current <TT>`Makefile'</TT> into the
directory, and configures the directory for compiling.  Note that these
actions remove any existing dependency information, so that a
<CODE>depend</CODE> action should be made following either of them.
<DT><SAMP>`make depend'</SAMP>
<DD>
This automatically adds dependency information for the files in this
directory onto the <TT>`CPU/Makefile'</TT> file.  This allows the make
command to know when to compile these files after something they depend
on has been touched (edited).
<DT><SAMP>`make makefiles, make make_depend, make new_make_depend'</SAMP>
<DD>
These actions simply combine some of the above steps together into one
action.  <CODE>makefiles</CODE> does a <CODE>new_makefile</CODE> and then a
<CODE>cpu_dir</CODE>, <CODE>make_depend</CODE> does a <CODE>cpu_dir</CODE> and then a
<CODE>depend</CODE>, and <CODE>new_make_depend</CODE> does all three of the necessary
steps: <CODE>new_makefiles</CODE>, <CODE>cpu_dir</CODE>, and <CODE>depend</CODE>.  The only
reason you should not use the latter all the time is if your <CODE>make</CODE>
program has trouble using a new <TT>`Makefile'</TT> (i.e., as created by the
<CODE>make new_makefiles</CODE> action) for calling the subsequent actions.  In
this case, you have to first do a <CODE>make new_makefiles</CODE> and then you
can do a <CODE>make make_depend</CODE>.
<DT><SAMP>`make force_ta'</SAMP>
<DD>
Forces a call to the TypeAccess scanning program <TT>`maketa'</TT>.
