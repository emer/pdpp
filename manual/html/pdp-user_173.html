In order to be able to view network stat variables (e.g., unit
activations) in one of the log displays (or record them to disk files),
these state variables need to be monitored with a <B>MonitorStat</B>.

</P>
<P>
The <B>NetView</B> provides a convenient interface for creating monitor
stats and selecting which objects to monitor and what values to monitor
from them (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_130.html">10.7.1  The Action Region</A>), as does the <B>Wizard</B> object
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_45.html">5.5  The Wizard Object</A>).

</P>

There are basically two parameters of relevance in the monitor stat.
One is the <CODE>objects</CODE> that are being monitored.  This is a group
which has links to the objects (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_91.html">8.2  Groups</A> for information on
links).  The other is the <CODE>variable</CODE> to record from these objects.
Note that if the variable is one found on units, but the object(s) are
layers, then the stat will automatically get the unit variable from all
of the units in the layer.  Similarly, if the variable is one on
connections, but the object(s) are projections, all of the connections
in the projection will be used.

</P>
<P>
Typically, the <CODE>net_agg</CODE> operator <CODE>COPY</CODE> is used.  This
results in a separate column of data for each object being monitored.
This data is stored in the <CODE>mon_vals</CODE> group on the monitor stat.
When these values are graphed or displayed in the grid log
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_188.html">13.3.4  The Graph LogView</A>, section <A HREF="pdp-user_194.html">13.3.5  The Grid LogView</A>), they appear as one big
group that shares the same axis on the graph and is part of the same
sub-grid on the grid.

</P>
<P>
However, one can compute any kind of network aggregation from the
monitored statistics, including MAX, AVG, etc.  These aggregations
produce a single value in the <CODE>mon_vals</CODE> group.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1048"></A>
It is also possible to perform three steps of pre-processing on the
monitored values before they are recorded or aggregated into the monitor
stat.  This pre-processing is controlled by the <CODE>pre_proc_1,2,3</CODE>
members, which specify an operation and, optionally, arguements to that
operation in the <CODE>arg</CODE> member.  Note that the thresholding function
<CODE>THRESH</CODE> compares the value to the <CODE>arg</CODE>, and gives a result
of <CODE>hi</CODE> if it is greater-than-or-equal, and <CODE>lo</CODE> if it is
less-than the arg.
