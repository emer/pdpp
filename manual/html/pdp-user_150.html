<H2><A NAME="IDX900" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">12.2  The Schedule Process (SchedProcess)</A></H2>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Instead of putting all the control necessary to iterate over the several
levels of processing needed to train a network (training, epochs,
trials, settles, cycles, etc.) into one process object, we have divided
up the processing hierarchy into a set of nested scheduling processes,
each of which handles one level of processing.  This results in a lot of
flexibility, since one can then change only the code controlling the
trial, for example, or easily extend it using a CSS script.

</P>
<P>
The Schedule Process (or <B>SchedProcess</B>) is an extension of the basic
Process type. It provides more variables and functions with which one
can control the execution of the Process.  It has fields for the parent
and child processes in its hierarchy, support for counters that
control the iteration of the process over time, places to link in
<B>View</B> objects and <B>Log</B> objects to be updated, and groups to
hold the various sub-processes and statistics that can be associated
with a given level of processing.

</P>
<P>
In order to support all of its extended functionality, the schedule
process has a somewhat complicated execution structure.  However,
understanding how a schedule process runs should make it easier to
figure out how to get them to do what you want them to.

</P>
<P>
The central function a schedule process performs is one of looping,
where the process repeated performs some function.  In most cases, this
function simply involves telling the process below it in the hierarchy
to run.  Thus, an epoch process repeatedly loops over the trial process,
for example.  The functions in a schedule process center around the main
loop of processing,

</P>
<P>
The main loop is written so as to be re-entrant.  Thus, something can
cause the process to pop out of the loop (i.e., the user pressing
<I>Stop</I>), and when it runs again, it will fall back down to the point
where it was last running and pick up again where it left off.

</P>
<P>
The places where the things that hang off of a schedule process, like
statistics, logs and displays, can all be seen in the main schedule
process loop code, which is reproduced here:

</P>
<PRE>void SchedProcess::C_Code() {
  bool stop_crit = false;        // a stopping criterion was reached
  bool stop_force = false;       // either the Stop or Step reached

  if(re_init) {                // if its time to re-initialize, then do it
    Init();                     // this sets the counters to zero, etc.
    InitProcs();                // this runs any initialization processes
  }

  do {
    Loop();                     // user defined code goes here
    if(!bailing) {
      UpdateCounters();         // increment the counters (before logging)
      LoopProcs();              // check/run loop procs (use mod of counter)
      LoopStats();              // update in-loop statistics
      if(log_loop)              // can log inside loop or after it...
        UpdateLogs();           // generate log output and update logs
      UpdateState();            // update process state vars (current event..)

      stop_crit = Crit();       // check if stopping criterion was reached
      if(!stop_crit) {         // if at critera, going to quit anyway, so don't
        stop_force = StopCheck(); // check for stopping (Stop or Step)
      }
    }
  }
  while(!bailing &#38;&#38; !stop_crit &#38;&#38; !stop_force);
  // loop until we reach criterion (e.g. ctr &#62; max) or are forcibly stopped

  if(stop_crit) {              // we stopped because we reached criterion
    Final();                    // user defined code at end of loop 
    FinalProcs();               // call the final procs
    FinalStats();               // run final_stats at end of loop
    if(!log_loop)
      UpdateLogs();             // if not logging in loop, logging at end 
    UpdateDisplays();           // update displays after the loop
    SetReInit(true);            // made it through the loop, so Init next time
    FinalStepCheck();           // always stop at end if i'm the step process
  }
  else {                       // we we're forcibly stopped for some reason
    bailing = true;             // now we're bailing out of all further procs
  }
}
</PRE>

<P>
The fall-through character of processing is made possible by storing all
of the counter state variables on the process object itself, so it is
preserved even when we pop out of the loop, and by only initializing
once we make it through the loop (by setting the <CODE>re_init</CODE> flag).

</P>
<P>
As you can see, there are two places where statistics get updated,
inside the loop (<CODE>LoopStats()</CODE>) and after the loop
(<CODE>FinalStats()</CODE>).  While it is more natural to think of computing
statistics at the end of the loop (e.g., at the end of the trial or the
end of the epoch), the need to aggregate statistic values over time
(e.g., compute the sum of the squared-errors over an entire epoch)
necessitates inside-the-loop statistics.

</P>
<P>
Finally, it should be noted that all schedule processes are written to
allow any number of intervening processes to be added in to the
hierarchy at any point.  Thus, new and unanticipated levels of
processing can be introduced by the user without breaking the
assumptions of the existing process objects.  Basically, any time there
is a dependency of one level of processing on another (e.g., the trial
process looks to its parent epoch process to determine if it should be
testing or training the network), the dependent process searches through
the entire hierarchy for the type of process it depends on.
