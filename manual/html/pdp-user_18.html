<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.1.3  Weight Error Derivative Phase</A></H3>

<P>
In this phase, we calculate quantities called <I>dE/dw_ij</I> and
<I>dE/db_i</I> for all of the weights and all of the biases in the network.
These quantities again represent the negative derivative of the Error
with respect to the weights and the biases.  The formulae are:

</P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_18.html_sub_1.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="dE/dw_ij = dE/dnet_i * a_j 
"><P>
and
<P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_18.html_sub_2.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="dE/db_i = dE/dnet_i
">
</P>

<P>
After these error derivatives are calculated, there are two options.
They may be summed over an entire epoch of training, or they may be used
to change the weights immediately.  In the latter case, the variable
<I>dE/dw_ij</I> accumulates the value of this derivative over all of the patterns
processed within the epoch, and similarly for <I>dE/db_i</I>.

</P>
<P>
When the weight change is made, there are two further values 
calculated.  First, the exact magnitude of the change to be made is
calculated:

</P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_18.html_sub_3.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT=" deltaW_ij = lrate * dE/dw_ij + momentum * deltaW_ij
">
<P>
This expression introduces a learning rate parameter, which scales the
size of the effect of the weight error derivative, and a momentum
parameter, which scales the extent to which previous weight changes
carry through to the current weight change.  Note that in the expression
for <I>deltaW_ij</I> the value of <I>deltaW_ij</I> from the previous time step
appears on the right hand side.  An analogous expression is used to
calculate the <I>deltaBias_i</I>.  Finally, the weight change is actually
applied:

</P>
<IMG SRC="pdp-user_18.html_sub_4.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="w_ij += deltaW_ij
">
<P>
Once again, an analogous expression governs the updating of <I>bias_i</I>.
