<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.1.4  The XOR Problem</A></H3>

<P>
XOR is about the simplest problem requiring a hidden
layer of units between the inputs and the outputs.  For this reason,
it has become something of a paradigm example for the back propagation
learning algorithm.  The problem is to learn a set of weights that
takes two-element input patterns, where each element is a 1 or a 0,
and computes the exclusive-or (XOR) of these inputs.  XOR is a boolean
function which takes on the value '1' if either of the input bits is a
1, but not if both are 1:

<PRE>Table [XOREvents]:

       Input  Output

        0 0     0
        0 1     1
        1 0     1
        1 1     0
</PRE>

<P>
The output should be 1 if one of the inputs is 1; if neither is 1 or
if both is 1, the output should be 0. 

</P>
<P>
The environment for learning XOR consists of four events, one for each
of the input-output pairs that specify the XOR function.   In the
standard training regime, each pattern is presented once per epoch,
and training continues until the total squared error, summed across
all four input-output pairs falls below a criterion value.  The value
is usually set to something like .04.  With this criterion, all the
none of the cases can be off by more than about .2.

</P>
<P>
Various network configurations can be used, but for this example we will
use the configuration shown in Figure [XORNet].  In this configuration, the
input layer consists of two units, one for each input element; the
output layer consists of a single unit, for the result of the XOR
computation; and the hidden layer consists of two units.  The output
unit receives connections from both hidden units and each hidden unit
receives connections from both input units.  The hidden and output
units also have modifiable biases, shown in the figure as with
arrows labeled with 'b' coming in from the side.
