<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.2.4  Network and NetView Window</A></H3>

<P>
The <B>NetView</B> window (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_129.html">10.6  Network Viewer</A>) is an essential window for us
since it provides us with access to the network that we have created for
learning the XOR problem.  The <B>NetView</B> window has two sets of menus
along with lots of pushbuttons and a display area containing a graphical
display of the network. Lets take a look at the menus first.  The left
hand set of menus relate to the <B>Network</B> itself.  The right hand set
of menus relate to the <B>NetView</B>.  The <B>NetView</B> is an object,
actually a child of the <B>Network</B>, that provides a view of the
Network.  We can operate on either one, and we have two separate sets of
menus.

</P>
<P>
The left hand menus allow access to the <B>Network</B> itself and the
Networks' children: its <I>.views</I> and its <I>.layers</I>.  Most of these
menus have the same basic structure as we have already seen, but there
is one new menu, namely the <I>Actions</I> menu.  This menu allows us to
perform actions on the network itself, such as removing things from it,
initializing it, etc.  Some of the other actions we can perform are
accessible through the buttons to which we will turn in the next
paragraph.  The right hand menus allow us to access the <B>NetView</B>.
This is indicated by the label <I>View:</I> on this set of menus.  These
menus operate on the visual display of the network, or any operation
that interacts with the visual display (e.g., the <I>Selections</I> menu
operates on things that are selected in the visual display).

</P>
<P>
The <B>NetView</B> itself, the main body of the NetView window, provides a
graphical depiction of our network.  You can think of the layers of the
network arranged vertically, with the units within each layer laid out
on a two-dimensional sheet.  The input layer is located at the bottom of
the netview, with the two input units arranged side by side.  In
networks with many units per layer the units can be laid out in an X by
Y array.  The hidden layer is next above the input layer, and we can see
the two hidden units, again laid out side by side.  The output layer,
above the hidden layer, contains just a single unit, aligned to the left
of the netview.  At present, each unit is displaying its activation, as
indicated by the depressed appearance of the <CODE>act</CODE> button, together
with the yellow highlight.  The activation is shown in color in
accordance with the color bar shown at the right of the NetView, and by
the numeric value printed on it.  Either way we see that the activation
of all of the units is 0.

</P>
<P>
The <B>Network</B> has been initialized so that each unit has a random bias
weight and so that there are random weights on the connections between
the units.  We can examine these biases and weights by displaying them
on the netview.  First, to look at the bias weights, we can click on the
<I>bias.wt</I> button.  Once we do this, the units will assume colors
corresponding to their bias weights.  The biases on the input units are
not used and can be ignored.

</P>
<P>
We can also view weights either coming into or going out of a selected
unit.  The former are called 'receiving weights'.  To view the receiving
weights of the left hidden unit we first click on the button labeled
<I>r.wt</I>.  This activates the <I>View</I> button, and turns the cursor into
a little hand, indicating that we may now pick a unit to view its
receiving weights.  We can now click on the left hidden unit, and its
receiving or incoming weights are displayed on the units from which they
originate; the selected receiving unit is highlighted.  We see that this
unit receives incoming weights only from the two input units, both
somewhat positive.  We can proceed to click on other units to view their
incoming weights as well.  Note that the input units have no incoming
weights.  To see the outgoing or 'sending' weights from a unit, we
simply click the <I>s.wt</I> button, then click the unit whose sending
weights we wish to view.  You can verify that the values of the sending
weight from the left input unit to the right hidden unit is the same
value as the receiving weight to the right hidden unit.

</P>
<P>
Since all we've done so far is initialize the network's weights there
isn't that much else we can look at at this point.  However, if we click
on the <I>act</I> button, the network will be set to display the
activations of units later when we actually start to run the network.
Do this now.
