The basic structure of the backpropagation algorithm is reviewed in the
tutorial (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_15.html">4.1  Backpropagation and XOR</A>).  In short, there are two phases, an
activation propagation phase, and an error backpropagation phase.  In
the simplest version of Bp, both of these phases are strictly
feed-forward and feed-back, and are computed sequentially
layer-by-layer.  Thus, the implementation assumes that the layers are
organized sequentially in the order that activation flows.

</P>
<P>
In the recurrent versions, both the activation and the error propagation
are computed in two steps so that each unit is effectively being updated
simultaneously with the other units.  This is done in the activation
phase by first computing the net input to each unit based on the other
units current activation values, and then updating the activation values
based on this net input.  Similarly, in the error phase, first the
derivative of the error with respect to the activation (dEdA) of each
unit is computed based on current dEdNet values, and then the dEdNet
values are updated based on the new dEdNet.

</P>
<P>
To implement a new algorithm like Bp in PDP++, one creates new class
types that derive from the basic object types that make up a network
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_112.html">10  Networks (Layers, Units, etc)</A>), and scheduling processes (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_148.html">12  Processes and Statistics</A>).  These new
classes inherit all the functionality from the basic types, and specify
the details appropriate for a particular algorithm.  There are two ways
in which this specification happens--overloading (replacing) existing
functions, and adding new ones (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_88.html">8.1.1  What is an Object?</A>).

</P>
<P>
The new classes defined in the basic Bp implementation include:
<B>BpConSpec, BpCon, BpCon_Group, BpUnit, BpUnitSpec, BpTrial</B>, the
role of which should be clear from their names.  In addition, we have
added a <B>CE_Stat</B> that computes the cross-entropy error statistic,
much in the same way <B>SE_Stat</B> does (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_172.html">12.8.1  Summed-Error Statistics</A>).

</P>
<P>
Bias weights in PDP++ are implemented by adding a <B>BpCon</B> object
to the <B>BpUnit</B> directly, and not by trying to allocate some kind of
self projection or some other scheme like that.  In addition, the
<B>BpUnitSpec</B> has a pointer to a <B>BpConSpec</B> to control the updating
etc of the bias weight.  Thus, while some code was written to support
the special bias weights on units, it amounts to simply calling the
appropriate function on the <B>BpConSpec</B>.

</P>
<P>
The processing hierarchy for feed-forward Bp requires only a specialized
Trial process: <B>BpTrial</B>, which runs both the feed-forward
activation updating and error backpropagation phases.
