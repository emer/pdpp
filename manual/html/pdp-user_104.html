<P>

<P>
In its default mode, the project viewer displays all the networks,
environments, processes, and logs in your project using colored icons
for each.  By pressing the <CODE>View Specs</CODE> button, it will switch to
viewing the specs for this project, and then <CODE>View Project</CODE> will
switch back.  We begin by describing project mode, and then spec mode.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="IDX490" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">9.2.1  Project View Mode</A></H3>

<P>
In project mode, the following are the default colors:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>Pink</B>
<DD>
Networks
<DT><B>Green</B>
<DD>
Environments
<DT><B>Yellow</B>
<DD>
Schedule processes
<DT><B>Light Blue</B>
<DD>
Group of statistics within a schedule process
<DT><B>Slate Blue</B>
<DD>
The statistics themselves -- the lighter-colored stats are directly
computing values while the darker ones are aggregators of others.  If
you click <CODE>Show Aggs</CODE> then the set of linked aggregators is
displayed in aquamarine.
<DT><B>Red</B>
<DD>
Statistics with a stopping criterion set
<DT><B>Wheat</B>
<DD>
Group of processes within a schedule process
<DT><B>Gold</B>
<DD>
The sub-processes within a schedule process
<DT><B>Brown</B>
<DD>
Logs
</DL>

<P>
Non-obvious actions you can perform on icons:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>Single-click with left-mouse-button (LMB)</B>
<DD>
Will select or deselect item, and update the action buttons at the left
of the display.
<DT><B>Double-click with LMB</B>
<DD>
On objects with windows (networks, environments, logs), will iconify or
view the object.  On processes, will iconify or de-iconify the object
(an iconified process is collapsed so that you can't see all the
sub-processes below it).  Iconifying processes is important if you have
many process hierarchies -- they will not all fit in the display at
once.  Iconified processes are identifiable as being not colored.
<DT><B>Single-click with right-mouse-button (RMB)</B>
<DD>
Will bring up the edit dialog for that object.
<DT><B>Shift-LMB or middle-mouse-button</B>
<DD>
Extends the selection to include multiple items.
</DL>

<P>
Note that because much of what happens in the project view concerns
processes, you may need to read section <A HREF="pdp-user_148.html">12  Processes and Statistics</A> to understand everything that
goes on in this view.

</P>
<P>
Effects of action buttons on left side of display are (note that where
multiple are listed, the same button does different things depending on
what is selected -- they are described in order from left-right,
top-bottom).

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>Minimize</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX491"></A>
Shrinks the display to the smallest vertical size.  Note that at this
size, you can re-expand the display later by hitting the top of the
maximize button, which will be just visible at the bottom of the window.
<DT><B>Maximize</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX492"></A>
Expands the display vertically to fit all of the items in the display.
<DT><B>View Specs</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX493"></A>
Switches the display to viewing specs (mode described below).
<DT><B>Select</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX494"></A>
This is the standard mode -- causes mouse clicks to select objects.
<DT><B>Move</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX495"></A>
When in this mode, the mouse will move objects to different positions
within their respective groups (does not work for schedule processes).
For example, you can rearrange the order of statistics within a schedule
process by moving them.
<DT><B>Edit</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX496"></A>
Pulls up an Edit Dialog for selected object(s).
<DT><B>Init</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX497"></A>
Initializes the display (this is rarely necessary, as the display is
usually automatically updated when needed).
<DT><B>Iconify, DeIconify, Iconify All</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX498"></A>
Controls the iconification of windows or processes.
<DT><B>Show Links, No Links</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX499"></A>
Either shows or turns off showing the links between a selected item and
other objects -- the links show you how everything is connected up in
the project.  Links are drawn as solid lines for cases where a process
uses the object for processing (e.g., The network used by the train
process is shown as a pink solid line).  Dashed lines indicate that the
process updates the given object (e.g., the Trial process typically has
a dashed line to the network, indicating that it updates it).
<DT><B>Change Type, Rmv Updater, Add Updater</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX500"></A>
If one object is selected, Change Type will allow you to change the type
of that object.  If an object that can be updated (e.g., a network) and
a process object are selected, then it will allow you to either add or
remove an updating link between these objects.
<DT><B>New Stat, Set Agg, Set Agg Link</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX501"></A>
If a schedule process is selected, New Stat will allow creating a new
statistic in this object -- you will be prompted for whether to make it
in the loop or final stats group.  Note that if you know where you want
to put the new stat, and that stat group (loop_stats or final_stats)
already appears in the view (because it has other stats in it), then you
can just click right on the stat group and hit New Stat from there.

If a statistic is selected, Set Agg will allow you to set the kind of
aggregation this statistic should use.

If two statistics are selected, Set Agg Link will set one statistic to
aggregate from the other (order can be selected in a subsequent dialog).

<DT><B>Ctrl Panel</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX502"></A>
If a schedule process is selected, this will bring up its control panel.
<DT><B>New Process, New Agg, Transfer Obj</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX503"></A>
If a schedule process is selected, this will allow you to create a new
process in a process group (init_procs, loop_procs, final_procs) that
is not currently shown in the display.  Note that if the group you want
is already shown in the display, then just click on it and do New
Process from there.  If a stat is selected, New Agg will create a new
aggregator of that statistic.  If a stat or non-schedule process
together with a stat or process subgroup is selected, Transfer Obj will
transfer the stat/process to the group.  If a stat/process is selected
together with a schedule process, Transfer Obj will bring up a dialog
asking for which subgroup of that schedule process to transfer into.

<DT><B>New Scd Proc, New Process, New Stat, New Sub/Super, New Link, Transfer Obj</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX504"></A>
Transfer Obj on Project Viewer
If nothing is selected, New Scd Proc will create a new schedule process.

If a stat group (loop_stats, final_stats) is selected, New Stat will
create a new statistic in it.

If a process group (init_procs, loop_procs, final_procs) is selected,
New Process will create a new process in it.

If one schedule process is selected, this New Sub/Super will prompt for
creating a new schedule process above (super) or below (sub) the
selected one in the process hierarchy.

If two schedule processes are selected, New Link will prompt for linking
one process into a process group (init_procs, loop_procs, final_procs)
of the other (direction is determined by a dialog, but default is that
to to-be-linked process is first selected).  Also see next case:

If a schedule process and a process group (init_procs, loop_procs,
final_procs) on another schedule process are selected, then the schedule
process will be linked into the process group with a New Link.

If a group and a non-schedule process object are selected, then Transfer
Obj will transfer the object into the group.

<DT><B>New Proc Gp, Remove Obj(s), Remove Link</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX505"></A>
If nothing is selected, New Proc Gp will create a new process group for
organizing schedule processes into groups.

Will remove object(s) that are selected, or if two objects are selected
and they are linked, the link will be severed.
</DL>

<P>
In summary, it should be clear that the project viewer enables you to
establish linkages between different objects, and to perform detailed
configuration of the process hierarchy.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="IDX505" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">9.2.2  Spec View Mode</A></H3>

<P>
Spec view mode shares much in common with project view mode.  Specs are
arranged in the order they appear in the .specs menu, left-to-right and
then top-to-bottom.  The default colors are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>Violet</B>
<DD>
Unit Spec
<DT><B>Green</B>
<DD>
Con Spec
<DT><B>Orange</B>
<DD>
Projection Spec
<DT><B>Purple</B>
<DD>
Layer Spec
</DL>

<P>
Many of the the action buttons are similar to those in the project view
mode, with the following special actions:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>Edit</B>
<DD>
<DT><B>Set Spec</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX506"></A>
Brings up the view of the default network in the .networks group, and
applies the selected spec to whatever objects are selected in the
network view.  This is equivalent to performing Selections/Set XX Spec
in the NetView (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_134.html">10.8  Building Networks Using the Viewer</A> for more details) where XX is the
type of Spec that was selected.  This provides a convenient way of
applying a given spec to selected parts of the network.

<DT><B>Show Spec</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX507"></A>
This is like the inverse of Set Spec -- it selects whatever objects in
the network are currently using the selected spec.

<DT><B>New Child</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX508"></A>
On either a spec or the <CODE>children</CODE> group of a spec, will prompt for
creating a new child spec of the selected item.

<DT><B>New Spec</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX509"></A>
Allows one to create a new spec.

<DT><B>New Spec Gp</B>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX510"></A>
Allows one to create a new spec group for organizing specs into groups.
