<P>
Like C and C++, CSS has several different places that it can put
variables and functions.  Some of these amount to ways of organizing
things that have a similar role in the same list, so that they can all
be viewed together.  These are essentially transparent to the user, and
are described in the context of the various commands that print out
lists of various types of functions and variables.  The remaining
distinctions have consequences for the programmer, and are described
below.

</P>
<P>
The initial program space in CSS is different than that of C or C++,
since it can actually contain executable code, whereas the compiled
languages restrict the basic top-level space to consist of definitions
only.  Any definitions or variables declared in the top-level space are
by default considered to be <CODE>static</CODE>, which means that they are
visible only to other things within that program space.  Other program
spaces (such as those in a <CODE>Script</CODE> object or a
<CODE>ScriptProcess</CODE>, <CODE>ScriptEnv</CODE>, etc.) do not have access to
these variables or functions.  However, the <CODE>extern</CODE> declaration
will make a variable or function visible across any other program
spaces.

</P>
<P>
Within a function, all variables declared as arguments and local
variables are known as "autos", as they are automatically-allocated.
These are stored locally on a kind of stack within the same object that
holds the code for the function, and a new set of them are allocated for
each invocation of the function.  The exception is for variables
declared <CODE>static</CODE>, which are also stored on the function object,
but the same one is used for all invocations of the function.

</P>
<P>
All new types that are declared (including enums and classes) are put in
the global typespace, which is available to all program spaces.
