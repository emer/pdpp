<H2><A NAME="IDX758" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">11.1  Environments</A></H2>

<P>
The <B>Environment</B> is used by the processes to present inputs to the
<B>Network</B>, and to provide training values for the network as well.  At
appropriate intervals, the processes will ask the environment for an
<B>Event</B>. The event is a snapshot or instance of the environment at a
given time. It is up to the environment to generate the appropriate
event given an index presented by the processes. Typically, these
events are precomputed and the environment simply iterates over the a
list of events. Optionally, an environment can perform more complicated
event choosing operations and can even modify or generate events on the
fly if so desired (supported by the <B>InteractiveScriptEnv</B>,
section <A HREF="pdp-user_147.html">11.11  Other Environment Types</A>). 

</P>
<P>
Sometimes the events may need to be further organized into subgroups of
events in order to represent groups of events that belong in a
particular sequence (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_139.html">11.3  Representing Sequences of Events</A>). Specialized processes like the
<B>SequenceEpoch</B> and the <B>SequenceProcess</B> interact with the
Environment by asking it for one of these subgroups of Events. The
Sequence Epoch allows updating of weights and other operations to occur
after the entire "batch" of events in the Event SubGroup has been
presented (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_162.html">12.6.1  Processes for Sequences of Events</A>).

</P>
<P>
In summary, there are three different interfaces to the environment:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>1.</B>
<DD>
A flat list of events accessed by event index (supported by the standard
<B>EpochProcess</B>).  <CODE>InitEvents()</CODE> is called at the start, and a
<B>ScriptEnv</B> can render a batch of events for each epoch.
<DT><B>2.</B>
<DD>
Groups of events accessed first by group index, then by index of event
within group (supported by <B>SequenceEpoch</B> and <B>SequenceProcess</B>,
section <A HREF="pdp-user_162.html">12.6.1  Processes for Sequences of Events</A>).  This allows for subsets of events to be
grouped together as a sequence.  Again, <CODE>InitEvents()</CODE> is called
at the start of the entire epoch.
<DT><B>3.</B>
<DD>
An 'interactive' model that doesn't depend on indicies at all,
supported by <B>InteractiveEpoch</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_163.html">12.6.2  Processes for Interactive Environments</A>).  This
allows for events to depend on what has just happened in the network.
<CODE>InitEvents()</CODE> is called at the start of an epoch, and
<CODE>GetNextEvent()</CODE> is called for each new event until it returns a
NULL.  In a <B>IneractiveScriptEnv</B>, <CODE>GetNextEvent()</CODE> calls the
script, and returns the event in the <CODE>next_event</CODE> pointer (which
needs to be set by the script) -- see section <A HREF="pdp-user_147.html">11.11  Other Environment Types</A> for details.
</DL>

<P>
In the generic <B>Environment</B> class there are two groups:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Event_Group events</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX759"></A>
This is where the events are stored.
<DT><CODE>BaseSpec_Group event_specs</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX760"></A>
This is where the <B>EventSpec</B> objects are stored.  Note that event
specs, unlike other specs, reside in the environment, and not in the
<B>Project</B> <CODE>.specs</CODE> group.  This makes environments self-contained
so that they can be loaded and saved independent of the project.
</DL>

<P>
The following functions are defined on the <B>Environment</B> object.  Note
that a given process will either use the Group model or the Event model
of the environment.  The group model is for sequences, which are stored
in subgroups, and the event model treats the environment just like a
flat list of events.  These functions are on the <I>Actions</I> menu:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>InitEvents()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX761"></A>
Initializes events for an epoch. Used for algorithmically generated
events which are generated at the start of each epoch.  This does
nothing in the base class, but in a <CODE>ScriptEnv</CODE> it calls the
script, which can then generate events.
<DT><CODE>UpdateAllEvents()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX762"></A>
Updates all events in accordance with their corresponding event
specs.  This should happen automatically but things can get out of
whack and this should clean everything up.
<DT><CODE>UpdateAllEventSpecs()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX763"></A>
Updates all events in accordance with their corresponding event
specs.  This should happen automatically but things can get out of
whack and this should clean everything up.
<DT><CODE>EventCount()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX764"></A>
Returns the number of events in the Environment.  This is used by the
processes to determine how long an epoch should be.
<DT><CODE>GroupCount()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX765"></A>
Returns the number of event groups in the Environment, for
sequence-based processing.  This determines how many sequences go in an
epoch. 
<DT><CODE>GetNextEvent()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX766"></A>
Returns the next event for processing (or NULL to signal the end of
the epoch).  This is the interface for the interactive environment
model (hook for generating new event based on current state).
<DT><CODE>UnitNamesToNet(EventSpec* event_spec_with_names, Network* network)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX767"></A>
Copies names from pattern spec <CODE>value_names</CODE> to corresponding units
in the network.  Uses default event spec and network if NULL.  This is
a convenient way to name units in the network -- these names are
otherwise lost when the network is rebuilt.
<DT><CODE>AutoNameAllEvents(float act_thresh, int max_pat_nm, int max_val_nm)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX768"></A>
Automatically name all events based on the pattern names and value
(unit) names for those units with activations above act_thresh, e.g.,
<CODE>Inp:vl1_vl2,Out:vl1_vl2</CODE>.  There are also versions of this
functionality in Events and Event specs.
</DL>

<P>
The following functions are defined in the <I>Object</I> menu and provide
additional input/output functionality:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ReadText(ostream&#38; strm, EventSpec* espec, TextFmt fmt)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX769"></A>
Reads in an Environment from a text file which is in the format from
the old PDP software, or other formats based on the fmt parameter.
This uses the given event spec which must correspond to the pattern
file being read in.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_143.html">11.7  Importing Environments from Text Files</A>.
<DT><CODE>WriteText(istream&#38; strm, int pat_no, TextFmt fmt)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX770"></A>
Writes an Environment to a text file in the format from the old PDP
software, or other formats.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_143.html">11.7  Importing Environments from Text Files</A>.
<DT><CODE>ReadBinary(ostream&#38; strm, EventSpec* espec)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX771"></A>
Reads in an Environment from a binary file, which must be just a
continuous stream of floating point numbers that are applied in
sequence to the patterns and events of the environment.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_143.html">11.7  Importing Environments from Text Files</A>.
<DT><CODE>WriteBinary(istreamm&#38; strm, int pat_no=-1, TextFmt fmt = NAME_FIRST)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX772"></A>
Writes an Environment to a binary file as a continuous stream of
floating point numbers.  See section <A HREF="pdp-user_143.html">11.7  Importing Environments from Text Files</A>.
</DL>

<P>
The following are function interfaces used by processes to access events:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>GetEvent(int event_number)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX773"></A>
Returns a pointer to the Event corresponding to <CODE>event_number</CODE>.
The event number should be between 0 and <CODE>EventCount()</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>GetGroup(int group_number)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX774"></A>
Returns a pointer to the Event group corresponding to
<CODE>group_number</CODE>, which should be between 0 and <CODE>GroupCount()</CODE>.
