<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.3.4  Setting Up Control Processes</A></H3>

<P>
While the <B>Network</B> and the <B>Environment</B> constitute the bulk of the
custom aspects of a simulation, the way in which the network is trained
can vary depending on what kinds of tasks you are performing, etc.  The
training and testing of a network is determined by the processes, and
the results of running these processes can be viewed in logs that record
data over time.

</P>
<P>
Processes come in hierarchies, but there are sensible defaults built
into the program that create sensible hierarchies. We will create two
hierarchies, one for training the network, and one for testing.  Should
your process hierarchy become accidentally misaligned with unnecessary
Train, Epoch and Testing processes or spurious Batch or Sequence
processes, you may wish to start the process creation procedure over
from scratch by choosing <I>.processes</I> / <I>Remove</I> / <I>All</I>.
In this case, the default naming of the processes may use a different
numbering convention than the one described below, but hopefully you
will be able to follow along.

</P>
<P>
To create the <B>TrainProcess</B>, select <I>.processes</I> / <I>New</I> /
<I>TrainProcess</I> from the Project window.  A New Object Popup window
will appear indicating that 1 Train Process should be created. In
addition, the <I>Create Subprocs</I> toggle will be checked; leave this, it
will do the right thing and create a subordinate Epoch and Trial process
under the Train process for you automatically.  Use the right mouse
button to click <I>Ok</I> so you can edit the Train process.  If you forget
to use the right mouse button, you can edit the train process by
selecting <I>.processes</I> / <I>Edit</I> / <I>Train_0</I>. You could at this
point rename the train process to something more descriptive, (e.g.,
"Training") by changing its name field, but we'll assume you stay with
the default, which is just Train_N, where N is the index of this
instance of a train process; if this is the first process you are
creating, the process will be called Train_0.  One thing you can notice
here is the max epoch value associated with the Train process.  By
default it has value 1000, which is reasonable for many relatively small
scale problems -- if it doesn't learn in 1000 epochs, it may not learn
at all.  We are done with editing the Train Process at this point, so
you should press <I>Ok</I> and dismiss the Edit Dialog.

</P>
<P>
Now, take a look at your Project window, which shows all of the major
objects within your project.  You should see the network and
environment, and the three processes in the process hierarchy you just
created.  You can automatically view or iconify the network or
environment windows by double-clicking on their icons.  Also, you can
see how everything is connected up through the processes by clicking on
a process and hitting show links -- select the yellow <I>Trial_0</I> icon
and then hit the <I>Show Links</I> button.  You should see that this
process works on the network (solid pink line) and the environment
(solid green line), and that it updates the network display (dashed pink
line).  You can also see the statistics that are computed at each level
of processing (more on this below).

</P>
<P>
We can now edit the sub-process Epoch_0, either clicking with the right
mouse button on the <I>Epoch_0</I> object in the project view, or by
choosing its name from the <I>.processes</I> / <I>Edit</I> / <I>name</I>
menu. Again, you could rename them at this point; but we'll assume you
stay with the default name of Epoch_0.  The main reason to edit the
Epoch process is to specify the presentation order and what mode of
weight updating you want by setting the values of the <I>order</I> and
<I>wt update</I> fields in the edit dialog for Epoch_0.  The defaults,
<CODE>PERMUTED</CODE> and <CODE>ONLINE</CODE> may not be what you want
(<CODE>SEQUENTIAL</CODE> <CODE>BATCH</CODE> is the "standard" combination).

</P>
<P>
By default, the TrialProcess for the Bp algorithm creates a
squared-error statistic.  You can see this statistic in the project
view, or by pulling down the edit menu, and moving the mouse over any of
the processes -- it shows up in a sub-menu off of the these processes.
In general, statistics are created at the <B>TrialProcess</B> level,
because that is the appropriate time-grain for the computation of most
statistics.  For the squared-error, this is when an individual pattern
has been presented, the activations propagated through the network, and
a difference between the target and actual output values is available
for computing the error.  However, one often wants to see an
<I>aggregation</I> of the error (and other statistic) over higher levels of
processing (e.g., a sum of the squared-error over an entire epoch of
training).  This is done by creating aggregates of the statistic, and it
is why all of the processes contain a squared-error statistic in them --
the ones in the Epoch and Train processes are aggregations of the one
computed in the TrialProcess.

</P>
<P>
While you could procede to the next step now, we will make a small
detour in order to show you how to create statistics, since you may in
the future want to create a different type of statistic than the default
squared-error statistic.  We will simply remove the existing statistic,
and then perform the steps necessary to recreate it.  To remove the
statistic, you can click on it (under the <I>Trial_0</I> process) and hit
<I>Rmv Obj(s)</I> button in the project view, or select <I>.processes</I> /
<I>Remove</I> / <I>Trial_0</I> / <I>sum_Trial_0_SE_Stat</I>, and confirm that it
is <I>Ok</I> to close (remove) this item.  Note that the SE_Stat has been
removed from all of the processes -- a statistic will always remove its
aggregators in higher-level processes when it is removed.

</P>
<P>
Now we will perform the steps necessary to re-create the statistic we
just removed.  You can do this by either selecting the <I>Trial_0</I>
object in the project view, and hitting <I>New Stat</I>, or by selecting
<I>.processes</I> / <I>New Stat</I> / <I>SE_Stat</I> in the <B>Project</B> window
(<I>New Stat</I> is near the bottom of the menu).  The popup that appears
indicates the type and number; it also indicates which process the stat
will be created in.  As mentioned above, statistics are generally
created at the <B>TrialProcess</B> level, because that is the appropriate
time-grain for the computation of most statistics.  Given that there is
only one Trial process (Trial_0) at this point, the program will guess
correctly and suggest to create the SE_Stat at this level.  The popup
also allows you to choose where within the Trial process to create the
statistic -- with the two options being Loop and Final.  Most statistics
will know where to create themselves, so the <I>DEFAULT</I> selection
should be used, which means it is up to the stat's own default where to
go.  You'll want to create aggregates (summing over trials at the epoch
level, and keeping track of the latest value at the overall Train
process level), so leave the <I>Create Aggregates</I> toggle checked.
Click <I>Ok</I>.

</P>
<P>
Now you get to answer another question: What aggregation operator do you
want for the next (epoch) level?  The default <CODE>LAST</CODE> (keep track of
just the last value) is not what we need; you want to <CODE>SUM</CODE> this
stat at the next level, so select <CODE>SUM</CODE>, and then click <I>Ok</I>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the stat is also being aggregated at the levels above the
epoch (i.e. the <B>Train</B> level).  It will keep track of the last value
at the <B>Train</B> level.  Note that at each level each statistic has a
name refelcting the process and the nature of the aggregation.  So the
Train level stat is called "lst_sum_Train_0_SE_Stat" indicating it is
the last value of the sum of an <B>SE_Stat</B> and that it is attached to
the Train level.  We have now re-created the squared-error statistic.
You could have skipped over this process, but now you know how to do
this in the future.

</P>
<P>
Finally, you need to set the stopping criterion for learning, which is
not set by default.  You can do this by editing the "Train_0_SE_Stat".
You find it by right-clicking (or selecting and hitting <I>Edit</I>) the
object in the project view, or by doing <I>.processes</I> / <I>Edit</I> /
<I>Train_0</I> / <I>lst_sum_Train_0_SE_Stat</I>.  Once this pops up you will
find the <CODE>se</CODE> value of this stat near the bottom of the
window. This field has 1 parameter <CODE>val</CODE> which indicates the
current value of the statistic, and 4 parameters which control when the
stopping actually occurs. To set the criteria you need to click on the
first stopping paramater, <CODE>stopcrit</CODE> which should turn on with a
checkmark symbol indicating that we are indeed using this statistic as a
stopping criteria. The default relation <CODE>&#60;=</CODE> on the next parameter
to the right is appropriate here so ther is no need to adjust its
value. To the right of the relation parameter is the value to which the
statistic is measured against. In our case, the <CODE>val</CODE> of this SE
statistic is compared with this value to determine if it is less than or
equal to it.  A reasonable value for this parameter is .04 (.01 for each
pattern you are testing, summed over patterns). The next field labeled
<CODE>cnt</CODE> can be used to set a stricter stopping criterion where the
condition must be met <CODE>cnt</CODE> times in a row instead of just once.
We will just leave the value at 1. Click <I>Ok</I> when you are done.

</P>
<P>
You will probably also want to create a Test process hierarchy.  A test
sweeping through all of your patterns is an <B>EpochProcess</B>.  So,
select <I>.processes</I> / <I>New</I> / <I>EpochProcess</I>. After you click
<I>OK</I> (use right mouse button to edit) in the popup window, go ahead
and edit this process (if you didn't use right-click, select
<I>.processes</I> / <I>Edit</I> / <I>Epoch_1</I>).  Set <CODE>wt_update</CODE> to
<CODE>TEST</CODE> and <CODE>order</CODE> to <CODE>SEQUENTIAL</CODE>.  Click <I>Ok</I>.  Note
that a default SE_Stat was automatically created for your test process.
There is no need to set any stopping criteria.

</P>
<P>
Now, you probably want to monitor some aspect of network function in
your test.  Let's look at the activation of the output units.  To do
this:

</P>

<IL>
<LI>

Select the units in the output layer in the <B>NetView</B> (either the whole
layer, or all the units in the layer).

<LI>

Select <I>act</I> to display on the <B>NetView</B>.

<LI>

Click <I>Monitor Values</I> / <I>New</I> (located in the left-middle of the
<B>NetView</B> display).

<LI>

In the pop-up, set the process to "Trial_1".  You'll find it under
<I>BpTrial</I> when you click on the <CODE>In Process</CODE> value field.
Everything else is as we want it so click <I>Ok</I>.
</IL>

<P>
Also, it is useful to create an EpochCounterStat for the test process by
selecting <I>.processes</I> / <I>NewStat</I> / <I>EpochCounterStat</I>, then,
when the pop-up appears, for <I>In Process</I>, select <I>Trial_1</I>, then
click <I>OK</I> (or select <I>loop_stats</I> under the <I>Trial_1</I> object in
the project view, and then pick <I>EpochCounterStat</I> from the dialog).
When the program asks you how to aggregate this statistic, it will
remember the value you entered last time (<CODE>SUM</CODE>), but we will want
to use <CODE>LAST</CODE> this time. This will allow you to record information
about how many epochs the network has been trained on each time you run
a test.

</P>
<P>
Now, so you'll be able to run the net and test it, you can create
control panels for training and testing.  In the project view, select
the <I>Train_0</I> object and hit <I>Ctrl Panel</I>, and then the same for
<I>Epoch_1</I>, or do <I>.processes</I> / <I>Control Panel</I> / <I>Train_0</I> for
the training panel and <I>...</I> / <I>Epoch_1</I> for the testing panel.  In
the Train_0 control panel, you might set the <CODE>step</CODE> <CODE>n</CODE> field
to something like 30, so that when you click step it will run for 30
epochs.
