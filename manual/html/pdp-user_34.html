<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.3.2  Making a New Network</A></H3>

<P>
Now, lets make the <B>Network</B>.  Select <I>.networks</I> / <I>New</I> /
<I>Network</I> and <I>Ok</I>.  You now have a blank <B>Network</B> object, and a
<B>NetView</B> window in which to view it.

</P>
<P>
Click <I>New Layer(s)</I>, set the <CODE>Number</CODE> to 3 (by editing the number
field or using the increment/decrement buttons), and hit <I>Ok</I>.  Your
three layers will appear, but at this point none of them contain any
units.  The <B>NetView</B> is now in <I>ReShape</I> mode (the corresponding
mode button is highlighted).  So, if you select "Layer_0", you can start
to reshape it.  Click and hold in the line you see above the layer label
(this line is a layer-frame with no space in it yet) and drag the mouse
to the right; boxes will appear corresponding to unit-spaces.  When you
have 4, stop and let go.  You've created a frame for four units.  Click
on the line above "Layer_1" to create a frame for the two hidden units;
drag right until two boxes appear.  Finally click on the line above the
"Layer_2" label, and create a frame for the four output units. You now
have frames but no units; to create the units, in all three layers at
once, just click on <I>Build All</I>.  The units should all now be visible,
and the default <I>act</I> variable selected, indicating that your are
viewing their activation states, which should all be zero.

</P>
<P>
You can move the hidden layer to be centered, by selecting <I>Move</I> mode
then dragging the hidden layer with the mouse.  Note that things move in
"chunks" of the size of a single unit, so you will have to move the
mouse a certain amount before the layer itself moves.  It's a good idea
to go back to Select mode after moving by hitting <I>Select</I>.

</P>
<P>
Also, clicking the <I>Init</I> button will adjust the display of the
network to fill the available space, and generally fix any display
problems.  It is automatically performed most of the time, but you can
use the <I>Init</I> button if the display doesn't look right for some
reason.

</P>
<P>
Now we need to make connections.  Actually, you first make
<B>Projection</B>s then create connections within the projections.  A
projection is to a connection what a layer is to a unit; it represents a
bunch of connections that connect units in two layers.  In any case, you
need to create two projections.  One to the hidden layer from the input
layer, and one to the output layer from the hidden layer.  In each case:

</P>

<IL>
<LI>

Select the receiving layer with the left mouse button.  You want to
see the frame around all of the units highlighted.  This should occur on
the first click; if that's not what you see, keep clicking until it is; 
(you're cycling the selection through the layer, all the units, and the
unit under the mouse).  

<LI>

Add the sending layer to the selection using the "extend-select", which
can be done with either the middle mouse button, or the Shift key plus
the left mouse button, depending on whether you come from a Unix or a
Mac background.  Now both the sending and receiving layers should be
highlighted. If you make a mistake, click the left mouse button in the
background area of the NetView between the layers to unselect the layers
and start over with the previous step.

<LI>

When you have 2 layers selected, click <I>New Prjn(s)</I>, which will be
highlighted. A Projection arrow should appear between the two layers.
Note that the arrow head of the projection arrow is unfilled (outline)
indicating the the actual connections have not been created yet.
</IL>

<P>
After you do this for both projections you will have two unfilled
arrows.  Now click <I>Connect All</I> and your projections will be filled
with connections to each unit on the receiving end from each unit on the
sending end. Now the arrow heads of the projections will be solid
indicating that their connections have indeed been created. You may
verify this by clicking on the <I>r.wt</I> button and using the finger
pointer to view the weights of some of the hidden and output units.
When you are finished looking around, return to viewing the activations
by pressing <I>act</I>.

</P>
<P>
And your network is complete.
