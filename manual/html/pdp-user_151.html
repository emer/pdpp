<H3><A NAME="IDX902" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">12.2.1  Variables and Functions used in a SchedProcess</A></H3>

<P>
The SchedProcess provides the following variables and functions (in
addition to the ones already provided by the basic Process):

</P>

<H2>12.3  Variables</H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>bool can_stop</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX903"></A>
This variable is a flag that controls whether the SchedProcess can be
interrupted during execution.  This also determines if GUI events are
being processed.  Things can be speeded up a bit if this flag is turned
off for low-level processes like the <CODE>CycleProcess</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>TypeDef sub_proc_type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX904"></A>
This is type of process the <CODE>sub_proc</CODE> should be. If the
<CODE>sub_proc</CODE> type does not inherit from this type then a new
<CODE>sub_proc</CODE> is created of the correct type.
<DT><CODE>SchedProcess* sub_proc</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX905"></A>
This is a pointer to the child Process (if it exists) of this
SchedProcess.  This is the sub process that the process iterates over.
<DT><CODE>StepParams step</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX906"></A>
It is possible to single-step (or multiple step) through processing, and
this controls how the <I>Step</I> function behaves. The <CODE>step</CODE>
variable contains a pointer to the sub-process under the current one
that represents the time-grain at which stepping should occur.  The
number of times this step process is iterated per each <I>Step</I> (i.e.,
each time the user hits the <I>Step</I> button) is determined by the
<CODE>n</CODE> parameter.
<DT><CODE>Stat_Group loop_stats</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX907"></A>
This is a group that contains the Statistic processes that will be
executed within the loop of the schedule process (i.e., called by
<CODE>LoopStats()</CODE> in the loop code shown above).  Thus, for a epoch
process, these stats will be computed after every trial, since the epoch
process loops over trials.  These are typically aggregation stats, which
are adding up values computed in the trial process.  For example the
epoch sum of squares error would be aggregated in the epoch loop stats.
<DT><CODE>Stat_Group final_stats</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX908"></A>
This is a group that contains the Statistic processes that will be
executed at the end of the loop for this process.  This is typically
where statistics go which are computed for the first time (i.e., not
those that are simply aggregating values computed lower down in the
hierarchy).
<DT><CODE>Process_Group init_procs</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX909"></A>
This contains miscellaneous processes that get executed when the process
is initialized.  Note that these are run only when the process is
actually running, <EM>not</EM> when the <I>ReInit</I> or <I>NewInit</I> buttons
are hit.  Thus, if you hit one of these buttons, and then do a <I>Run</I>,
the first thing that will happen when the process is run is that the
init_procs will be executed.
<DT><CODE>Process_Group loop_procs</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX910"></A>
These are miscellaneous processes that get executed inside the loop of
the process.  For example, it is possible to link in a testing epoch
process into the <CODE>loop_procs</CODE> of a training <B>TrainProcess</B>, with
a mod value set to 10, for example, which will result in the network
being tested after every 10 epochs of training.
<DT><CODE>Process_Group final_procs</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX911"></A>
These are miscellaneous processes that get executed after the loop of
the process, just before the final stats are computed.
<DT><CODE>bool log_loop</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX912"></A>
Either the process sends its data at the end of its processing loop,
which is the "natural" (and default) way to do things, since it
corresponds with the name of the process (the end of the epoch process
means once every epoch, while the loop of the epoch process is actually
the end of every trial!), or it sends its data inside the loop, which
can be useful to see the aggregation of the <CODE>loop_stats</CODE> statistics
over time.  This flag, if checked, means that it logs inside the loop.
<DT><CODE>bool log_counter</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX913"></A>
This flag determines if the counter associated with this process (e.g.,
the epoch counter in the <B>TrainProcess</B>) is logged along with all the
other data that is logged.
</DL>

<P>
Many of the core functions on the schedule process object were
documented in the main loop code shown previously.  In addition to the
functions on the process object, the following functions are available
in a schedule process (most can be found in the <I>Actions</I> menu of the
edit dialog or control panel).

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>InitMyLogs()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX914"></A>
Clear all logs that this process updates.
<DT><CODE>InitAllLogs()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX915"></A>
Clear all logs that exist in the Project that this SchedProcess is in.
<DT><CODE>InitNetwork()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX916"></A>
Initialize the weights in the network associated with this process
(calls <CODE>InitWtState()</CODE> on the network).
<DT><CODE>InitAll();</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX917"></A>
Initialize the process, network weights, and logs.
<DT><CODE>RemoveFromLogs();</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX918"></A>
Remove this SchedProcess from all the logs in the <CODE>logs</CODE> group and
clear out the <CODE>logs</CODE> group.
<DT><CODE>RemoveFromDisplays();</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX919"></A>
Remove this SchedProcess from all the displays in the <CODE>displays</CODE>
group and clear out the <CODE>displays</CODE> group.
<DT><CODE>CheckAllTypes();</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX920"></A>
This goes through all the objects in the network and makes sure that
they are all of the minimum type necessary for all of the processes
statistics being computed by this processing hierarchy.  This is done
automatically whenever the training process is initialized, but it can
be done manually just to make sure.  This check is useful, especially if
you are experiencing unexplained crashing, because many process objects
assume that the objects in the network are of the appropriate type.
</DL>

<P>
The following are a set of functions that are particularly useful for
configuring the processing hierarchy, and appear in the <I>Structure</I>
menu of a SchedProc.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>MoveToSubGp(const char* gp_name)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX921"></A>
This moves the current process and all of its sub-processes to a new
sub-group within the <CODE>.processes</CODE> group of the project.  Run this
on the top-level process in a process hierarchy.  This is useful for
organizing the menu when several processing hierarchies are present in
the same project.
<DT><CODE>ChangeNameSuffix(const char* new_name_sufx)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX922"></A>
This changes the portion of the sched process names after the underbar
(_) to the new specified name.  This is the preferred way to give a
whole hierarchy of sched procs the same semantically meaningful tag
(e.g., a suffix of "Trn" for training processes, and "Tst" for testing
processes.)  Run this on the top level process, as it works on all
sub-processes.
<DT><CODE>AddSuperProc(TypeDef* type)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX923"></A>
This will add a new schedule process above this one, of the given type,
while preserving as much of the existing structure as possible.  Thus,
any aggregated stats will be aggregated through the new super proc, and
it is inserted so that any previous super proc is now the super proc to
the new super proc, etc.
<DT><CODE>AddSubProc(TypeDef* type)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX924"></A>
Like AddSuperProc, but adds a new process below this one.
<DT><CODE>RemoveSuperProc(TypeDef* type)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX925"></A>
This is effectively the inverse of AddSuperProc -- removes parent
process and closes up any existing aggregation links, etc.
<DT><CODE>RemoveSubProc(TypeDef* type)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX926"></A>
This is effectively the inverse of AddSubProc -- removes sub
process and closes up any existing aggregation links, etc.
