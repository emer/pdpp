<H2><A NAME="IDX183" HREF="ta_css_toc.html">6.2  The TypeAccess System</A></H2>

<P>
The TypeAccess system consists of a set of objects that can hold
type information about class objects.  This type information includes
the names and types of all the members and methods in a class, the
parents of the class, etc.  This information can be used by classes to
get information about themselves at run time.  In addition, the
TypeAccess system provides a set of type-aware base classes and macros
for defining derived versions of these that can be used to easily
incorporate run-time type information into any C++ system.

</P>
<P>
In addition to being type-aware, the base classes can use their own type
information to save and load themselves automatically to and from ASCII
format text files.  Further, there is an extensible graphical interface
based on InterViews which can automatically build editing dialogs for
filling in member values and calling member functions on arbitrary
objects.  Finally, the type information can be used to provide a
transparent script-level interface to the objects from the CSS script
language.  This provides the benefits of compiled C++ for fast
execution, and the ability to perform arbitrary interactive processing
in an interpreter using the C++ language supported by CSS.

</P>
<P>
Many features of the interface and script level interface, as well as
various options that affect the way objects are saved and loaded, can be
specified in comments that follow the declaration of classes, members,
and methods.  These <I>comment directives</I> constitute a secondary
programming language of sorts, and they greatly increase the flexibility
of the interface.  They are documented in section <A HREF="ta_css_36.html">6.3  Standard TypeAccess Comment Directives</A>.

</P>
<P>
Thus, the PDP++ software gets much of its functionality from the
TypeAccess system.  It provides all of the basic interface and
file-level functionality so that the programmer only needs to worry
about defining classes that perform specific tasks.  These classes can
then be flexibly used and manipulated by the end user with the generic
TypeAccess based interface.
