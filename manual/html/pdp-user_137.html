Events are the snapshots of the Environment presented to the Network.
They represent a single coherent set of stimuli drawn from the
environment.  They are comprised of a set of patterns, which hold the
information affecting the network on a layer by layer basis.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX781"></A>
The structure of an event is determined by its corresponding
<B>EventSpec</B>.  Any changes made in the event spec are automatically
made to all of the events that use that event spec.  Thus, there must be
one event spec for each different type of event created.  Event specs
reside in the environment itself, and not in the Project like other
specs.  The <B>Event</B> has a pointer to its spec, called <CODE>spec</CODE>.
This works just like other spec pointers (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_100.html">8.4  Specifications</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX782"></A>
<A NAME="IDX783"></A>
Both the <B>Event</B> and <B>EventSpec</B> objects are essentially just
containers for their constituent <B>Pattern</B> and <B>PatternSpec</B>
objects, which are also kept in one-to-one correspondence.  Thus, any
new pattern specs added in the <CODE>pattern</CODE> group in an event spec
will result in corresponding patterns in the <CODE>pattern</CODE> group on the
event.  Different varieties of events will add event-level parameters
like frequency and time (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_146.html">11.10  Frequency Environments and Events</A>, section <A HREF="pdp-user_147.html">11.11  Other Environment Types</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX784"></A>
<A NAME="IDX785"></A>
A <B>Pattern</B> is simply a list of real numbers, which are kept in a
floating-point <B>Array</B> object called <CODE>value</CODE>. It can be "applied"
to a specified layer in the network.  Each element of the value array in
the Pattern corresponds to a Unit in the Layer.  In addition, one can
assign a flag to each value, which will alter how this value is applied
to the units in the network.  The <CODE>flag</CODE> member of a Pattern holds
the flags, which are only present if the <CODE>use_flags</CODE> field in the
corresponding pattern spec is set to <CODE>USE_PATTERN_FLAGS</CODE> or
<CODE>USE_PAT_THEN_GLOBAL_FLAGS</CODE>. All of the flags are independent of
each other and be either on or off. The meaning of the flag values are
given in the <CODE>PatFlags</CODE> enumerated type in the <B>PatternSpec</B> and
listed below.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TARG_FLAG</CODE>
<DD>
unit's TARG flag is set
<DT><CODE>EXT_FLAG</CODE>
<DD>
unit's EXT flag is set
<DT><CODE>COMP_FLAG</CODE>
<DD>
unit's COMP flag is set
<DT><CODE>TARG_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>
pattern value goes to the unit targ field
<DT><CODE>EXT_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>
pattern value goes to the unit ext field
<DT><CODE>NO_UNIT_FLAG</CODE>
<DD>
no unit flags are set, but value is set as normal
<DT><CODE>NO_UNIT_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>
don't set the unit's value, but flag as normal
<DT><CODE>NO_APPLY</CODE>
<DD>
don't apply this value to unit (no flags either)
</DL>

<P>
The options include the ability to control how the unit's external input
will be flagged, and where the value will be copied on the Unit (i.e.,
to its <CODE>targ</CODE> or <CODE>ext</CODE> field).  This gives the user complete
control over how the pattern value is presented.

</P>
<P>
Note that the <CODE>value</CODE> field is an <CODE>float_RArray</CODE> type, which
has a range associated with it (hence the RArray), and it also has a
number of other useful functions that enable the distance between two
arrays to be computed, or various statistics like the mean, variance,
etc. to be computed on a given array.  These functions may be useful in
creating and analyzing patterns.

</P>
<P>
The <B>PatternSpec</B> has several fields which determine where its
corresponding pattern is presented, and what meaning it has to the
network:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>PatType type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX786"></A>
The type of the pattern, which determines how the network will interpret
its values.  This can be one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>INACTIVE:</CODE>
<DD>
The corresponding pattern is not presented to the network.
<DT><CODE>INPUT:</CODE>
<DD>
The corresponding pattern is presented to the network as external input
activation: the value is copied to the <CODE>ext</CODE> variable of the
corresponding Unit, and the <CODE>EXT</CODE> flag is set on the
<CODE>ext_flags</CODE> of the unit (and the layer the unit is in).
<DT><CODE>TARGET:</CODE>
<DD>
The corresponding pattern is presented to the network as target
activation: the value is copied to the <CODE>targ</CODE> variable of the
corresponding Unit, and the <CODE>TARG</CODE> flag is set on the
<CODE>ext_flags</CODE> of the unit (and the layer the unit is in).
<DT><CODE>COMPARE:</CODE>
<DD>
The corresponding pattern is presented to the network as comparison
pattern, which does not affect activation states or learning, but can be
used to compare output values to expected ones via error statistics
(e.g., the <B>SE_Stat</B>). The value is copied to the <CODE>targ</CODE> variable
of the corresponding Unit, and the <CODE>COMP</CODE> flag is set on the
<CODE>ext_flags</CODE> of the unit (and the layer the unit is in).
</DL>
<P>
<DT><CODE>PatLayer to_layer</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX787"></A>
The network layer to present the Pattern to. This can be one of the
following values:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>FIRST:</CODE>
<DD>
Apply to the first layer in the network.
<DT><CODE>LAST:</CODE>
<DD>
Apply to the last layer in the network.
<DT><CODE>LAY_NAME:</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the Layer to apply to by name. The name should be set in the
variable <CODE>layer_name</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>LAY_NUM:</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the Layer to apply to by layer number. The number should be set
in the variable <CODE>layer_num</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>
<DT><CODE>String layer_name</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX788"></A>
Contains the name of the layer to apply to (used if <CODE>to_layer</CODE> is
set to <CODE>LAY_NAME</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>Int layer_num</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX789"></A>
Contains the number of the layer to apply to (used if <CODE>to_layer</CODE> is
set to <CODE>LAY_NUM</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>TypeDef* pattern_type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX790"></A>
Determines the type of <B>Pattern</B> object that is created in events
that use this pattern spec.  Changing this after events have already
been created will <EM>not</EM> cause them to change pattern types.  You
have to remove the Events and start over if you want to change the types
of patterns that are used.
<DT><CODE>LayerFlags layer_flags</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX791"></A>
Determines how the layer's <CODE>ext_flags</CODE> will be set.  The
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> is to set them according to the pattern <CODE>type</CODE> as
described above, but they can be set to any of the possible combinations
of flags (<CODE>TARG, EXT, COMP</CODE>), or to <CODE>NO_LAYER_FLAGS</CODE> at all.
This can be useful if you have an pattern which uses flags for different
values (see <CODE>use_flags</CODE>) so the layer actually receives multiple
different kinds of external input.
<DT><CODE>PatUseFlags use_flags</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX792"></A>
Determines how the <CODE>flag</CODE> field of the Pattern and the
<CODE>global_flags</CODE> of this PatternSpec will be used when applying the
Pattern to the network.  This can be one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>USE_NO_FLAGS:</CODE>
<DD>
Both pattern flags and global flags are ignored
<DT><CODE>USE_PATTERN_FLAGS:</CODE>
<DD>
Patterns flags are applied, global flags are ignored
<DT><CODE>USE_GLOBAL_FLAGS:</CODE>
<DD>
Global flags are applied, individual pattern flags are ignored
<DT><CODE>USE_PAT_THEN_GLOBAL_FLAGS:</CODE>
<DD>
If any flags are set on the pattern then use all the pattern's flag
settings, otherwise apply the global flags for that pattern. Note that
the choice of global versus pattern flags is not done individually by
each flag on the pattern but rather as an all or nothing check on each
pattern to determine if any of its flags are set.
</DL>
<P>
<DT><CODE>int n_vals</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX793"></A>
The number of values to create in the corresponding pattern.  It
should be equivalent to the number of units in the corresponding layer.
If this value is set to 0, it will be filled in with the number of units
on the corresponding layer of the default network in the current
project, if the layer can be found.
<DT><CODE>PosTDCoord geom</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX794"></A>
Determines the shape of the values as displayed in the
<B>EnviroView</B>.  It should correspond to the geom of the
corresponding layer, and is initialized as such if possible.
<DT><CODE>PosTDCoord pos</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX795"></A>
The position of the start of the event in the <B>EnviroView</B>.
Any overlap of displayed patterns is detected automatically, and the
<CODE>LinearLayout</CODE> action on the EventSpec can be called to arrange the
events linearly across or down the display.
<DT><CODE>float initial_val</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX796"></A>
The initial value that will be placed in newly created pattern
<CODE>value</CODE> arrays.
<DT><CODE>Random noise</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX797"></A>
This adds random noise of the given specification as the pattern is
applied to the network.
<DT><CODE>String_Array value_names</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX798"></A>
The elements in this array are in one-to-one correspondence with the
values in the pattern, and can be used to label the patterns in the
<B>EnviroView</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_140.html">11.4  The EnviroView</A>).  This is very useful 
<DT><CODE>int_Array global_flags</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX799"></A>
This contains flags that can apply (depending on <CODE>use_flags</CODE>) to
all of the patterns, determining how they are presented.
</DL>

Note: the following information should be useful to those who wish to
program in PDP++, but is not necessary for the average user to
understand.
