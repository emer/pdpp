<H1><A HREF="ta_css_toc.html">3  Introduction to TypeAccess/CSS</A></H1>

<P>
TypeAccess (TA) and CSS were developed in order to automate the
interface to a neural-network simulation package called PDP++.  This
manual is simply a subset of the PDP++ software manual, and it has a
number of references to PDP++ specific objects and issues.  Just ignore
these.

</P>
<P>
The TA/CSS system was designed to provide an automatic interface to C++
objects.  The members and functions on the objects define what the user
can do, and the GUI (graphical user interface) and script-level
interface simply provides a way of accessing the members and methods of
these objects.  Also, a generic, automatic way of saving and loading
objects and structures of objects to disk is provided.

</P>
<P>
The TypeAccess system makes this possible by automatically parsing the
header files in an application directory and creating a record of the
critical type information needed to make the GUI and script interfaces
to these objects.  This type information is also available for the
programmer, as with all RTTI (run-time type information) systems.

</P>
<P>
Unlike most RTTI systems, TA also records the comments from the source
code, which provides the prompts and "comment directives" for the
automatic interface.  The comment directives control how the member or
function is presented to the user, making the interface quite versatile.

</P>
<P>
CSS is an interpreted script language that uses the C/C++ syntax.  It
implements most of C and much of the basics of C++.  See
section <A HREF="ta_css_13.html">5.3.1  Differences Between CSS and C++</A> and section <A HREF="ta_css_14.html">5.3.2  Differences Between CSS and ANSI C</A> for details on the
discrepancies.  It has a built-in command system for controlling
the execution and debugging of programs.

</P>
<P>
CSS is implemented in C++ as a set of objects that basically know how to
"run" themselves, convert themselves into other types, etc.  TypeAccess
can generate a set of "stub" functions for class member functions which
take CSS object arguments, and return a CSS object.  These stub
functions provide the basis for the CSS interface to hard-coded
classes, and for GUI buttons and pull-down menus which call member
functions.

</P>
<P>
The same kind of automatic GUI is also available for classes defined in
CSS.  Thus, it is possible to create entire applications with automatic
GUI interfaces without compiling a line of code.  This same code can
then be compiled with C++ when the application is stable enough to
warrant compiling.

</P>
<P>
CSS can also be used as a stand-alone program like Perl or TCL.  This
provides the ability to write shell-like scripts in C/C++ instead of
learning a complicated new language (use the complicated language you
already know..).  The basic version of CSS has the GNU libg++ String
object as a basic type, as well as standard stream-based I/O, and all of
the usual functions from <TT>`unistd.h'</TT> and <TT>`math.h'</TT>, plus some
additional special math functions.  It would be fairly simple to parse a
good C++ matrix library under TA/CSS (this is on the 'todo' list), or
some classes that provide faster I/O primitives for doing specific
file-processing tasks, network protocols, etc.

</P>
<P>
The distribution includes a number of low-level objects which provide
transparent access to the TA type information, and basic container
functions like List, Group, and Array, as well as a host of other object
types that were used to implement the PDP++ software.
