<H2><A NAME="IDX190" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">7.3  CSS For C/C++ Programmers</A></H2>

<P>
This section outlines the ways in which CSS differs from C and C++.
These differences have been kept as small as possible, but nonetheless
the fact that CSS is an interactive scripting language means that it
will inevitably differ from compiled versions of the language in some
respects. 

</P>
<P>
Note that this manual does not contain an exhaustive description of the
CSS language -- only differences from standard C/C++.  Thus, it is
expected that the user who is unfamiliar with these languages will
purchase one of the hundreds of books on these languages, and then
consult this section to find out where CSS differs.
