Simple recurrent networks (SRN) <CITE>Elman, 1988</CITE> involve the use of
a special set of context units which copy their values from the hidden
units, and from which the hidden units receive inputs.  Thus, it
provides a simple form of recurrence that can be used to train
networks to perform sequential tasks over time.  <B>New for 3.0:</B> the
<B>BpWizard</B> has a <CODE>Network/SRNContext</CODE> function that will
automatically build an SRN context layer as described below.

</P>
<P>
The implementation of SRN's in PDP++ uses a special version of the
<B>BpUnitSpec</B> called the <B>BpContextSpec</B>.  This spec overloads
the activation function to simply copy from a corresponding hidden unit.
The correspondence between hidden and context units is established by
creating a single one-to-one projection into the context units from the
hidden units.  The context units look for the sending unit on the other
side of their first connection in their first connection group for the
activation to copy.  This kind of connection should be created with a
<B>OneToOnePrjnSpec</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_118.html">10.3.2  The Projection Specification</A>).

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Important:</STRONG> The context units should be in a layer that
<EM>follows</EM> the hidden units they copy from.  This is because the
context units should provide input to the hidden units before copying
their activation values.  This means that the hidden units should update
themselves first.

</P>
<P>
The context units do not have to simply copy the activations directly
from the hidden units.  Instead, they can perform a time-averaging of
information through the use of an updating equation as described below.
The parameters of the context spec are as follows:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1263"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>float hysteresis</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1264"></A>
Controls the rate at which information is accumulated by the context
units.  A larger hysteresis value makes the context units more sluggish
and resistant to change; a smaller value makes them incorporate
information more quickly, but hold onto it for a shorter period of time:
<PRE>  u-&#62;act = (1.0 - hysteresis) * hu-&#62;act + hysteresis * u-&#62;act;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>Random initial_act</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1265"></A>
These parameters determine the initial activation of the context units.
Unlike other units in a standard Bp network, the initial state of the
context units is actually important since it provides the initial input
to the hidden units from the context.
</DL>

<P>
Note that the SRN typically requires a sequence model of the
environment, which means using the sequence processes
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_162.html">12.6.1  Processes for Sequences of Events</A>).  Typically, the activations are initialized
at the start of a sequence (including the context units), and then a
sequence of related events are presented to the network, which can then
build up a context representation over time since the activations are
not initialized between each event trial.

</P>
<P>
The defaults file <TT>`bp_seq.def'</TT> contains a set of defaults for Bp
that will create sequence processes by default (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_205.html">14.1.7  Bp Defaults</A>).

</P>
<P>
The demo project <TT>`demo/bp_srn/srn_fsa.proj.gz'</TT> is an example of a
SRN network that uses the sequence processes.  It also illustrates the
use of a <B>ScriptEnv</B> where a CSS script is used to dynamically
create new events that are generated at random from a finite state
automaton.
