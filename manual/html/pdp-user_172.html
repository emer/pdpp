The <B>SE_Stat</B> object is a stat that iterates over the units that have
target values in a network, and computes the difference between the
activation and the target value.  This is useful for monitoring learning
performance over training.  The current value of this statistic can be
found in the <CODE>se</CODE> member.  Also, there is a <CODE>tolerance</CODE>
parameter which causes absolute differences of less than this amount to
result in zero error.  Thus, if one only was interested in whether the
network was on the right side of .5, you would set the tolerance to .5
(assuming a 0 to 1 activation range).

There is also a <B>CE_Stat</B> and a <B>RBpSE_Stat</B> defined in the Bp
version of the executable.  These compute the cross-entropy error
statistic and a version of squared-error that takes into account the
<CODE>dt</CODE> parameter of the recurrent backprop algorithm.

The <B>MaxActTrgStat</B> computes an error statistic based only on the
most active unit in the target layer(s).  If this most active unit
(max act) has a target value of 1, then there is no error, otherwise
there is an error.  This statistic is useful when there are multiple
possible correct answers, and the network is expected to just choose
one of them.  Thus, if its maximum act is a target, it is correct, and
otherwise it is not.
