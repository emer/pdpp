<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.2.5  The Environment</A></H3>

<P>
A second type of object contained in our Project is the <B>Environment</B>.
The environment can be thought of as a special object that supplies
events (training examples) on request.  In real life, if our network
were embedded in the brain of some organism the training experiences
would arise from the world.  In the simulator we will imagine that we
sample events from the environment when a process requests them.  In
general the environment can itself be an arbitrarily complex process,
but in the present case, the environment simply contains a list of
'events', each of which in turn consists of an input-output pattern
pair.  If we double click on the iconified <B>EnviroView</B> window, we can
inspect the objects corresponding to each of these Events.  The window
that pops up displays the names of all four of the events that make up
the 'XOR' problem.  You can inspect any one of these events by clicking
on the appropriate button, and if you do you will see that it consists
of two patterns, an input and an output pattern.  You can display all
four together, by first clicking the left mouse button on the first
event button, then clicking the middle mouse button on the other event
buttons in order.  The color scale indicates the correct interpretation
of the colors that indicate the activations of the units.  Once you
check this out you can go ahead and iconify the <B>EnviroView</B> window
again.
