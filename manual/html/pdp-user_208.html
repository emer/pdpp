The recurrent backprop implementation (RBp) defines a new set of types
that are derived from the corresponding Bp versions: <B>RBpConSpec,
RBpUnit, RBpUnitSpec, RBpTrial, RBpSequence</B>.  Note that RBp uses the
same Connection type as Bp.  In addition, support for the Almeida-Pineda
algorithm is made possible by the following set of process types, which
control the activation and backpropagation phases of that algorithm,
which otherwise uses the same basic types as RBp: <B>APBpCycle, 
APBpSettle, APBpTrial, APBpMaxDa_De</B>.

</P>
<P>
There are a couple of general features of the version of recurrent
backprop implemented in PDP++ that the user should be aware of.  First
of all, the model used is that of a discrete approximation to a
continuous dynamic system, which is defined by the sigmoidal activation
of the net input to the units.  The granularity of the discrete
approximation is controlled by the <CODE>dt</CODE> parameter, which should be
in the range between 0 and 1, with smaller values corresponding to a
finer, closer to continuous approximation.  Thus, the behavior of the
network should be roughly similar for different <CODE>dt</CODE> values, with
the main effect of <CODE>dt</CODE> being to make updating smoother or rougher.

</P>
<P>
Also, there are two ways in which the units can settle, one involves
making incremental changes to the activation values of units, and the
other involves making incremental changes to the net inputs.  The latter
is generally preferred since it allows networks with large weights to
update activations quickly compared to activation-based updates, which
have a strict ceiling on the update rate since the maximum activation
value is 1, while the maximum net input value is unbounded.

</P>
<P>
As in standard backpropagation, recurrent backprop operates in two
phases: activation propagation and error backpropagation.  The
difference in recurrent backprop is that both of these phases extend
over time.  Thus, the network is run for some number of activation
update cycles, during which a record of the activation states is kept by
each unit, and then a backpropagation is performed that goes all the way
back in time through the record of these activation states.  The
backpropagation happens between the receiving units at time t and the
sending units at the previous time step, time t-1.  Another way of
thinking about this process is to unfold the network in time, which
would result in a large network with a new set of layers for each time
step, but with the same set of weights used repeatedly for each time
step unfolding.  Doing this, it is clear that the sending units are in
the previous time step relative to the receiving units.

</P>
<P>
The exact length of the activation propagation phase and the timing and
frequency of the backpropagation phases can be controlled in different
ways that are appropriate for different kinds of tasks.  In cases where
there is a clearly-defined notion of a set of distinct temporal
sequences, one can propagate activation all the way through each
sequence, and then backpropagate at the end of the sequence.  This is
the default mode of operation for the processes.

</P>
<P>
There are other kinds of environments where there is no clear boundary
between one sequence and the next.  This is known as "real time" mode,
and it works by periodically performing a backpropagation operation
after some number of activation updates have been performed.  Thus,
there is a notion of a "time window" over which the network will be
sensitive to temporal contingencies through the weight updates driven by
a single backpropagation operation.  In addition, these backpropagations
can occur with a period that is less than the length of the time window,
so that there is some overlap in the events covered by successive
backpropagation operations.  This can enable longer-range temporal
contingencies to be bootstrapped from a series of overlapping 
backpropagations, each with a smaller time window. 

</P>
<P>
There is a simpler variation of a recurrent backpropagation algorithm
that was invented by Almeida and Pineda, and is named after them.  In
this algorithm, the activation updating phase proceeds iteratively until
the maximum change between the previous and the current activation
values over all units is below some criterion.  Thus, the network
settles into a stable attractor state.  Then, the backpropagation phase
is performed repeatedly until it too settles on a stable set of error
derivative terms (i.e., the maximum difference between the derivative of
the error for each unit and the previously computed such derivative is
below some threshold).  These asymptotic error derivatives are then used
to update the weights.  Note that the backpropagation operates
repeatedly on the asymptotic or stable activation values computed during
the first stage of settling, and not on the trajectory of these
activation states as in the "standard" version of RBp.  The
Almeida-Pineda form of the algorithm is enabled by using the <B>APBp</B>
processes, which compute the two phases of settling over cycles of
either activation propagation or error backpropagation.
