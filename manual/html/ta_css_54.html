<H3><A NAME="IDX295" HREF="ta_css_toc.html">7.6.1  Member Fields</A></H3>

<P>
The member fields in an edit dialog can be found to the right of the
member name. These member fields can appear in many different forms.
Sometimes there may even be more than one on a line.

</P>

<H2>7.7  Field Editor</H2>

<P>
The Field Editor is used for editing strings (e.g., an object's name), and
number values. It appears as a box with text in it. If you click on the
box an Ibeam cursor appears at the click location. When the mouse is in
the box, the characters you type will be entered at the Ibeam location
point as you would expect. 

</P>
<P>
<B>You must place mouse pointer in field to start editing!</B>  However,
once you have started typing, the mouse pointer need only remain in the
overall window. 

</P>
<P>
Some Emacs style editing keys are also recognized, in addition to the
standard keypad arrow and related keys:

</P>

<IL>
<LI>Ctrl-f moves Ibeam forward (also right arrow key)

<LI>Ctrl-b moves Ibeam backward (also left arrow key)

<LI>Ctrl-a moves Ibeam to beginning of line (also Home)

<LI>Ctrl-e moves Ibeam to end of line (also End)

<LI>Ctrl-d deletes character to right of Ibeam (also Del)

<LI>Ctrl-u selects the entire line -- subsequent typing replaces contents

<LI>Ctrl-n, TAB, or RETURN moves the Ibeam to the next field editor

<LI>Ctrl-p or Shift-TAB moves the Ibeam to the previous field editor

<LI>Alt-n moves to next object in list editor (also PageDn)

<LI>Alt-p moves to previous object in list editor (also PageUp)

</IL>

<P>
You can also hit shift-mousebutton2 (middle button) to scroll the text
with the hand cursor.

</P>
<P>
If the item to be edited is an integer then increment/decrement arrow
buttons will appear to the right of the field editor. Pressing on these
buttons will increase or decrease the value in the field editor.
Pressing button-1 (left button) changes the value by 1, button-2 (middle
button) changes the value by 10, and button-3 (right button) changes the
value by 100. If the mouse button is pressed and held, the action will
auto repeat.

</P>

<H2>7.8  Read Only Member Field</H2>

<P>
The read only member field is like the FieldEditor except the user
cannot edit the field. It is used for display purposes only.

</P>

<H2>7.9  Boolean CheckBox</H2>

<P>
The checkbox is used for boolean values that are either on or off.
Clicking on the checkbox changes its values. A checkmark or solid block
indicates an ON, TRUE or 1 value, while no checkmark or an empty box
indicates an OFF, FALSE or 0 value.

</P>

<H2>7.10  Enum Menus</H2>

<P>
The Enum menu is used for enumerated types. These types may have one of
a number of symbolic values. The menu is shown with the member's
current value. by clicking on the menu the other value choices appear in
a popup menu. Selecting an alternate value from the menu sets the menu's
value to the new value.

</P>

<H2>7.11  SubObject Menus</H2>

<P>
A SubObject menu is used when an instance of a class is part of the
edited object and that instance is not edited inline
(see section <A HREF="ta_css_54.html">7.6.1  Member Fields</A>). The menu has the name "Type: Actions" where
Type is the class name of the subobject. The menu contains the following
functions as well as object specific functions that are unique to the
subobject class.

</P>

<IL>
<LI>Load:             Load an instance of the subobject class

<LI>Save:             Save the subobject using a file requester

<LI>SaveAs:           Save the subobject with its last saved name

<LI>Edit:             Edit the subobject

</IL>


<H2>7.12  Object Pointer Menus</H2>

<P>
Object pointer menus are used when the member is a pointer to another
object. The current value of the pointer is shown in the menubar as the
pathname of the object that is pointed to. If the pointer is not set, the name
on the menubar will be set to NULL. Clicking on the menubar brings up a popup
menu of other objects of similar type. Selecting an alternate object sets the
menubar to the name of that object. The popup menu also allows the user to set
the pointer to NULL and to Edit the object currently pointed to.

</P>

<H2>7.13  Object Type Menus</H2>

<P>
The object type menus are used when a member specifies a type class of
object. This menu allows the user to select from classes which inherit
from it base class. The current selection is displayed in the menubar.

</P>

<H2>7.14  SubGroup Menus</H2>

<P>
The subgroup menu allows the user to interact with a group member of the
object. The name on the menubar is one of the two forms depending upon whether
or not the group has subgroups. (see section <A HREF="ta_css_68.html">8.2  Groups</A>).

Clicking on the menubar gives the user the following choices:

object. It appears as an  "Edit" menubar. Clicking on the menubar
gives the user the following choices:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

</DL>


<H2>7.16  Inline Fields</H2>

<P>
Inline Fields are used for small substructures within an object (e.g., an
object's position, which is only three values: x,y,z). Instead of the
expected SubObject menubar, the object is laid out horizontally across on
line in the Edit Dialog. The names of each of the fields are often
truncated so that the line will not take up too much space. This allows
quicker access and visualization without having to traverse through
multiple dialogs. The fields within an inline field behave as do the
rest of the fields in the dialog.
