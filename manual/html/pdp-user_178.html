<H3><A NAME="IDX1074" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">12.8.7  Statistics that Provide Counters (Time, Epoch, etc)</A></H3>

<P>
The following statistics all provide counter data, which are useful
for providing X-axes for graphing and other data analysis.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1075"></A>
The <B>EpochCounterStat</B> records the current epoch number from the
network.  This is useful for testing process hierarchies which start at
the epoch level and thus do not have an epoch counter from the training
process.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1076"></A>
The <B>ProcCounterStat</B> grabs a whole set of counters off of another
process.  It is used for the same reason an epoch counter stat is used,
except it also gives one access to batch counters and any other counters
that might be present on the training process hierarchy.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1077"></A>
The <B>TimeCounterStat</B> simply increments its counter every time it is
run, providing an ever-incrementing time count that spans across
multiple loops through a given level of the process hierarchy.  Use
the <B>TimeCounterResetProc</B> to automatically reset this time counter
at some higher level of the process hierarchy (e.g., at the start of
training, in the <CODE>TrainProcess</CODE> <CODE>init_procs</CODE>).
