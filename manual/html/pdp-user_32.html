<H2><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.3  Configuring the Encoder Problem</A></H2>

<P>
Running a canned exercise may be fun and informative, but most people
like to use simulation models to work on something new of their own.  In
this short section we will give you a quick overview of the essentials
of creating your own project.  We'll use the 4-2-4 encoder problem,
first considered by Ackley, Hinton and Sejnowski in their seminal
article on learning in Boltzmann machines.  We'll stay with the back
propagation learning algorithm, though, since it learns the problem much
faster than the Boltzmann machine.

</P>
<P>
In the 4-2-4 encoder problem, the goal is to learn to associate an input
pattern with itself via a small hidden layer (in this case containing 2
units).  There are 4 input units and 4 output units, and there are 4
training pattern-pairs, each involving one unit on, the same unit, in
both the input and the output:

</P>
<PRE>Input   Output
1000 -&#62; 1000
0100 -&#62; 0100
0010 -&#62; 0010
0001 -&#62; 0001
</PRE>

<P>
What we need to do is set up a network with four input units, four
output units, and two hidden units; then create an environment
containing the set of training patterns; then create the processes that
train and test the network, then create Logs and LogViews for displaying
the results of training and testing.

</P>
<P>
To begin, you just start up the executable for bp by typing <KBD>bp++</KBD>
at your unix prompt.  This starts the program, giving you the
<CODE>bp++</CODE> prompt as your command-line interface to the program, and
giving you a Root window as the seed of the GUI you are about to build
for yourself.  You're going to do the whole thing through the GUI.  You
can keep a script of what we've done so you can repeat the same steps
(or even edit them and do something slightly different) later.  This is
optional, however; many people prefer simply to save the state of their
configured project in a .proj file.

</P>
<P>
To create your project, select <I>.projects</I> / <I>New</I> / <I>Project</I> in
the Root window, and then just click <I>Ok</I> on the confirmation box that
appears. A project menu will appear.

</P>
