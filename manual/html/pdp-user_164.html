There are times when it is useful to be able to compare two different
networks as they simultaneously learn the same task, or compare the
learning of the same network on different environments.  This can be
accomplished by performing multiple streams of processing at the same
time.

</P>
<P>
The <B>SyncEpochProc</B> runs two different sub-processes through the same
set of events from a common environment.  Thus, it can be used to train
two different networks, even networks that use different algorithms, at
the same time.  It essentially just adds a set of pointers to a
<CODE>second_network</CODE> and a <CODE>second_proc_type</CODE> and
<CODE>second_proc</CODE>, which identify the second branch of the processes to
run, and which network to run them on.

</P>
<P>
The <B>ForkProcess</B> can be used more generically to split processing at
any level of the hierarchy.  Like the sync epoch process, it adds
pointers to the second fork of processing, including a
<CODE>second_environment</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT NOTE:</B> You need to specifically add small script processes
to the processes below a fork process that perform initialization and
other operations on the second network -- the standard processes will
only perform these operations on the first network!

</P>
<P>
One use of multiple processing streams is to combine two different
algorithms to form a hybrid network.  This can be done by synchronously
running both networks, each with their own algorithm-specific training
process, and linking them together with a <B>BridgeProcess</B>, which is
described in the next section.

</P>
<P>
The <B>MultiEnvProcess</B> can be used to iterate over multiple
environments within one processing stream.  This can be useful for
testing a number of different possible environments.
