<H4><A NAME="IDX651" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">10.3.3.4  Unit_Group Based Connectivity</A></H4>

<P>
There are a couple of classes that specifically pay attention to the
sub-groups of units within a layer, if these have been created (the
other types of projections just ignore this level of structure).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX652"></A>
<A NAME="IDX653"></A>
There is a sub-class of the full projection called the
<B>GpFullPrjnSpec</B>, which does the same thing the full prjn spec, but
creates separate connection groups based on the sending and receiving
unit-group structure.  Thus, the result is full connectivity, but this
is broken down so separate unit sub-groups can be treated separately
(e.g., if there were a weight-based competition between the units in a
sub-group, or between sub-groups).  The <CODE>n_con_groups</CODE> parameter
determines whether there is one con-group per <CODE>RECV_SEND_PAIR</CODE>, or
just one per <CODE>SEND_ONLY</CODE>, which is one con-group per unit-group on
the sending layer.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX654"></A>
The <B>GpOneToOnePrjnSpec</B> connects unit groups in two layers in a
one-to-one fashion, much as the OneToOnePrjnSpec connects units in a
layer in a one-to-one fashion.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX655"></A>
The <B>GpOneToManyPrjnSpec</B> connects one or more sending groups to all
receiving groups.  It can greate these connections in a number of
separate connection groups, or all in one group, depending on the
<CODE>n_con_groups</CODE> parameter (see GpFullPrjnSpec above).  Note that the
<CODE>recv_start</CODE> parameter is ignored, and only the <CODE>send_start</CODE>,
which determines which sending group to start with, and the
<CODE>n_conns</CODE>, which determines how many sending groups to use beyond
the start, are relevant.
