The <B>ProjectionSpec</B> class describes the patterns of connectivity
between units in the two layers involved in a projection.  The base
ProjectionSpec class is a parent class for the more specific Projection
Spec classes which are actually used (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_87.html">8.1  Object Basics</A>). Nonetheless,
it provides the basic functions and variables common to all Projection
Specs.

</P>
<P>
The projection spec actually implements many of the functions associated
with the projection, so functionality can be modified just by changing
the spec.

There are two variables that are common to all projection specs.  One is
the <CODE>self_con</CODE> flag.  This indicates if self-connections from a
unit to itself should be created in <CODE>SELF</CODE> projections.  The other
is <CODE>init_wts</CODE>, which indicates whether the connection weights
should be initialized from this projection spec (see Tessel and Random,
below) or via the ConSpec (which is the default, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_127.html">10.5  Connections</A>).
