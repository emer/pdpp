<H2><A HREF="ta_css_toc.html">4.1  Installing the End User's Version</A></H2>

<P>
After downloading the two tar files, <TT>`pdp++_version_bin_CPU.tar.gz'</TT>
and <TT>`pdp++_version_ext.tar.gz'</TT>, you need to decide where to locate
the files.  It is recommended that you put them in
<TT>`/usr/local/pdp++'</TT>, but they can be put anywhere.  However, the
<CODE>PDPDIR</CODE> environmental variable must then be set for all users to
the location it is actually installed in.  In addition if your CPU
supports shared libraries (all unix versions, including LINUX, IBMaix,
SUN4, HP800, SGI, but not DARWIN), you will need to insure that the
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environment variable includes the path
<CODE>PDPDIR/lib/CPU</CODE> where PDPDIR is the location of the pdp++
distribution, and CPU is your system type as described above (more
details on this below).  The following will assume that you are
installing in <TT>`/usr/local/pdp++'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Note: all of the PDP++ software is distributed in the gnu <TT>`gzip'</TT>
format, and it also uses gzip to automatically compress and decompress
the network, project, and environment files so that they take up less
space on your disk.  Thus, your system must have <TT>`gzip'</TT> installed
before proceeding.  It can be obtained from the GNU ftp server
(<TT>`gnudist.gnu.org'</TT>) or one of its mirrors, and is typically
installed on most modern systems anyway.

</P>
<P>
Go to the <TT>`/usr/local'</TT> directory, and issue the following command:
<PRE>  gzip -dc &#60;tarfile&#62; | tar -xf -
</PRE>

<P>
or, on Linux or other systems having a gnutar program
<PRE>  tar -xzf &#60;tarfile&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>&#60;tarfile&#62;</VAR> is the name of the tar archive file.  Note that
the tar files will create the pdp++ directory, or load into it if it
already exists.  Thus, if you have an old version of the software, be
sure to rename its directory something else before loading the new
files.

</P>
<P>
<B>LINUX users:</B> There is a special <TT>`.rpm'</TT> file that will install
the LINUX binaries and ext tar contents, including making links to the
binaries in /usr/local/bin, and installing the libIV.so library (and
links) in /usr/local/lib, and all of the ext-tra stuff in
/usr/local/pdp++.  To install this file, you need to be super-user, and
then execute the following command:
<PRE>  rpm -Uvh pdp++-binext-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the PDP++ specific libraires are still installed in
PDPDIR/lib/LINUX, so you still need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
include this path.

</P>
<P>
<B>Windows users (CYGWIN)</B>: There is a special <TT>`.exe'</TT> file that is
an auto-installing executable distribution of both the bin and ext tar
files described above.  This should be used to install under windows.
If you should install it in a location other than the default
<TT>`C:\PDP++'</TT> directory, you should add a <CODE>set PDPDIR=path</CODE> in
the <TT>`C:\autoexec.bat'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
<B>OS-X users</B>: There is a special <TT>`.pkg.sit'</TT> file that is
an auto-installing package file distribution of both the bin and ext tar
files described above.

</P>
<P>
All further references to file names, unless otherwise stated, assume
that you are in the PDPDIR directory (e.g., <TT>`/usr/local/pdp++'</TT>).

</P>
<P>
The files will get loaded into the following directories:

</DL>

<P>
You should either add the path to these binaries to your standard path,
or make symbolic links to these files in <TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT> or some
similar place which most user's will have on their path already.  For
example, in a csh-like shell (e.g., in the <TT>`~/.cshrc'</TT> file that
initializes this shell), add (for the LINUX CPU):
<PRE>set path = (/usr/local/pdp++/bin/LINUX $path)
</PRE>

<P>
or to make the symbolic links, do:
<PRE>cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /usr/local/pdp++/bin/LINUX/* .
</PRE>


<H2>4.2  Configuring the Libraries</H2>

<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> Most of the binaries are dynamically linked, which means
that the <TT>`pdp++_version_bin_CPU.tar.gz'</TT> file installed some dynamic
libraries in the <TT>`PDPDIR/lib/CPU'</TT> directory and in the
<TT>`PDPDIR/interviews/lib/CPU'</TT> directory.  When one of the PDP++
programs is run, it will need to know where to find these dynamic
libraries.  Thus you must set the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environmental
variable (using <CODE>setenv</CODE> under csh/tcsh) to point to both of these
locations.  For example, under LINUX with the standard PDPDIR:
<PRE>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pdp++/lib/LINUX:/usr/local/pdp++/interviews/lib/LINUX
</PRE>

<P>
It is a good idea to put this setting in your initialization
file for your shell (i.e. <TT>`~/.cshrc'</TT>).

</P>
<P>
It might be easier, especially if you want to use idraw or other
programs available under interviews, to copy the
<TT>`PDPDIR/interviews/lib/CPU/libIVhines.so*'</TT> (or .sl for HP800) file into
your <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT> or somewhere else that is already on your
dynamic linker's path.

</P>
<P>
<B>ADDITIONAL STEPS FOR libIV:</B> First, note that we are now using (as
of version 3.0) the version of InterViews maintained by Michael Hines
as part of the NEURON detailed neural simulation package.  This
library is now called <TT>`libIVhines'</TT>.  The latest version should
always be available at <TT>`ftp://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/unix/'</TT>,
with the current version being <TT>`iv-15.tar.gz'</TT> (also available on the
PDP++ ftp sites).

</P>
<P>
The interviews library in <TT>`PDPDIR/interviews/lib/CPU'</TT> is called
libIVhines.so.3.0.3 (or possibly other numbers instead of 3.0.3), but
on several unix systems (including LINUX, SGI, SUN4) the linker also
wants to see a libIVhines.so.3 and a libIVhines.so as different names
for this same file.  Therefore, you need to do the following in
whatever directory you end up installing libIVhines.so.3.0.3 (even if
you keep it in the original location, you need to do this extra step):
<PRE>ln -s libIVhines.so.3.0.3 libIVhines.so.3
ln -s libIVhines.so.3.0.3 libIVhines.so
</PRE>

<P>
(replace 3.0.3 and .3 with the appropriate numbers for the libIVhines
file you actually have).  Note that the .rpm install under LINUX does
this automatically.

</P>

<H2>4.3  Manual</H2>

<P>
The manual is distributed in several versions, including a postscript
file that can be printed out for hard-copy, a set of "info" files that
can be installed in your standard info file location and added to your
<TT>`dir'</TT> file for reading info files in gnu emacs and other programs,
and a directory called <TT>`html'</TT> which contains a large number of
<TT>`.html'</TT> files that can be read with <TT>`Netscape'</TT>, <TT>`Mosaic'</TT>
or some other WWW program.  Point your program at <TT>`pdp-user_1.html'</TT>
for the chapter-level summary, or <TT>`pdp-user_toc.html'</TT> for the
detailed table of contents. 

</P>

<H3>4.3.1  Help Viewer Configuration</H3>

<P>
There is now a <CODE>Help</CODE> menu item on all of the objects (under the
<CODE>Object</CODE> menu), which automatically pulls up the appropriate
section of the <TT>`html'</TT> version of the manual, using <TT>`netscape'</TT>
by default.

</P>
<P>
Under Windows (CYGWIN), the default help command is setup to use
<TT>`C:/Program Files/Internet Explorer/iexplorer.exe'</TT> -- if you
prefer netscape or any other HTML browser, this should be changed to the
full path to that executable.

</P>
<P>
Under Mac (DARWIN), the default help command is <TT>`open -a
\"Internet Explorer\" %s &#38;'</TT> -- this should work for most systems,
although you might want to use the new browser whatever it is called.

</P>
<P>
These defaults can be changed in the <CODE>Settings</CODE> menu of the
<CODE>PDP++Root</CODE> object, see @xref{proj-defaults} and section <A HREF="ta_css_57.html">7.17  Settings Affecting GUI Behavior</A>
for details.

</P>
<P>
The latest version of the manual is also available on-line from:
<PRE>  http://psych.colorado.edu/~oreilly/PDP++/PDP++.html
</PRE>


<H2>4.4  MS Windows Configuration</H2>


<H3>4.4.1  Memory Configuration</H3>

<P>
The PDP++ executables are compiled using an
environment called cygwin developed by Cygnus Solutions (now owned by
Red Hat Software).  The default cygwin configuration has an upper limit
of 128MB, which should work for most simulations.  However, you might
want to increase this limit if you are exploring larger simulations.

</P>
<P>
Open regedit (or regedt32) and find the key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin\

</P>
<P>
If this does not exist, you must create a new Key called 
Cygnus Solutions, and then another within it called Cygwin.

</P>
<P>
Then, create a new DWORD value under this key called
"heap_chunk_in_mb" that contains the maximum amount of memory (in Mb)
your application needs (watch the hex/decimal toggle -- you'll
probably want to set it to decimal).  For example if you wanted to set
the memory limit to 256Mb, just enter 256.  Exit and restart all
cygwin applications (e.g., pdp++).

</P>

<H3>4.4.2  Taskbar Configuration</H3>

<P>
Because the simulator uses many windows, the windows taskbar often does
not adequetly display the names of the windows.  This can be remediated
by dragging the top of the bar up, allowing more room for each icon.
Another approach is to grab the taskbar, drag it to the right edge of
the screen, drag the left edge to widen it, and then set it to auto hide
(right click on the taskbar, and select Properties to expose this
option, or go to the Start menu/Settings/Taskbar).  When all this has
been done, the window list can be exposed bringing the pointer to the
right edge of the screen.

</P>

<H2>4.5  Mac OS-X Configuration</H2>

<P>
PDP++ depends on having an XWindows (X11) server running on your mac.
Apple now has their own version of the XFree86 X11 server, which runs
very smoothly under the standard OSX window manager.  This is the
recommended solution.  Read more about it and download from:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/</CODE>

</P>
<P>
Basically, everything works just as under unix because this is a
fairly standard unix setup after all is said and done.  The manual
should therefore provide all the info you need.

</P>

<H2>4.6  Other Configuration</H2>

<P>
See @xref{proj-defaults} for instructions on how to setup customized
startup files if you want to change some of the default properties of
the system.

</P>
<P>
Happy simulating!
