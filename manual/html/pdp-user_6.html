The PDP++ software is based on the principles of object-oriented
software design.  The effects of this are pervasive, and an
understanding of these basic principles can help the user to understand
the software better.

</P>
<P>
First of all, everything in the software is an object: units,
connections, layers, networks, etc.  While this sounds intuitive for
these kinds of objects, other kinds of objects, like the object that
controls the way a network is viewed, or the ones that control the way
the network is trained, are somewhat less intuitive.  However, if you
just think of an object as representing some discrete piece or aspect of
the software, it makes more sense.  Essentially the PDP++ software is
just a big collection of objects that work together to let you get
things done.

</P>
<P>
The primary advantage of an object-oriented design is its
<EM>flexibility</EM>.  Because the functionality is broken up into
object-sized pieces, these pieces can be combined in many different ways
to accomplish many different tasks.  However, this power comes at the
price of <EM>simplicity</EM>---since everything is accomplished by the
interactions between multiple objects, setting things up to perform any
given task requires knowing which objects to use and how to configure
them.  The very distributed nature of the processing makes it less easy
to identify one single thing that needs to be operated on in order to do
something.  Its like the difference between a neural network and a
conventional computer program, in some sense.  In a computer program,
things proceed in a relatively linear, straightforward fashion from one
step to the next, whereas in a neural network, processing is distributed
among many different units that all work together to get something done.

</P>
<P>
While the tradeoff between flexibility and simplicity is inevitable to a
certain extent, we have endeavored to make the commonly-used tasks
simpler by including menus or buttons that do all of the right things in
one simple step.  However, as you become a more advanced user and want
to perform tasks that have not been "pre-compiled" in this way, expect
to encounter some of the difficulties associated with object-oriented
software.
