The <B>UnitActRFStat</B> computes an effective receptive field for units
based on their activation values when inputs are presented.  The idea is
to present a wide range of inputs to the network while performing a
weighted average over these input patterns as a function of the unit's
activation for each.  When you do this averaging, all the things that
the unit does not care about wash out, leaving an image of those things
that reliably activate the unit.  Assuming that the inputs span a large
enough space and provide for sufficient averaging, the resulting
receptive field can be much more informative than just looking at the
weights, since it takes into account any network dynamics, etc., and can
be computed on units any number of layers removed from the inputs.
Finally, the "input" that you average over need not literally be the
input layer to the network -- it could be the output, or an
intermediate hidden layer (or all of these at once).

</P>
<P>
This stat requires a stable database for accumulating the averaged
receptive fields -- an <B>Environment</B> is used for this purpose.  Note
that you have to do an <CODE>InitRFVals</CODE> in order to initialize this
environment before you start collecting the stats.  The statistics
collect until <CODE>InitRFVals</CODE> is run again.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>InitRFVals</CODE> can be performed automatically via a
<B>UnitActRFStatResetProc</B>, which can be put in the <CODE>init_procs</CODE>
of a higher processing level in the hierarchy.

</P>
<P>
This stat has the following parameters:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>layer</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1070"></A>
Set this to point to the units that you want to record the receptive
fields for.
<DT><CODE>rf_layers</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1071"></A>
This contains the layer(s) that you want to perform the averaging over
(the input in the above description).
<DT><CODE>data_env</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1072"></A>
This points to the <B>Environment</B> that contains the resulting receptive
fields, with one <B>Event</B> per unit.
