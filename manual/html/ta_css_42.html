<P>
This section describes the steps that need to be taken to define a new
class.  Every class based on the <B>taBase</B> type (i.e., all classes in
the PDP++ software) needs to have a set of standard methods (member
functions) that allow it to interface with the rest of the software.
Also, many commonly occurring data types and tasks that a class needs to
perform have been dealt with in a standardized way.  This chapter
familiarizes the programmer with these standards and interfaces.

<P>
Defining a new class is typically the first step a user will take in
programming with the PDP++ software.  This is because the software is
designed to be extended, not revised, by the user.  Fortunately, most
everything that is done by the PDP++ library code can be overwritten by
defining a new class that does something differently, or simply by
adding on to what the existing code does.  Both of these approaches
require the definition of a new class.

</P>
<P>
The first step in defining a new class is figuring out which existing
class to base the new one on.  This requires a knowledge of the existing
class structure, which is covered in this manual.  Once this has been
decided, the guidelines in this section should be followed as closely as
possible.  It is assumed that the reader knows C++ and the basic ideas
about constructors, destructors, virtual vs. non-virtual functions, etc.
