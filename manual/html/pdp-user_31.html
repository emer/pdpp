<P>
You can save the state of your simulation or virtually any part of it.
This is done by selecting <I>Object</I> / <I>Save</I> or <I>Object</I> / <I>Save
As</I> on the appropriate menu.  For example, to save the whole project
using its existing project name, you would select <I>Object</I> / <I>Save</I>
from the <B>Project</B> window.  To save just the network in the file
"myxor.net" you would select <I>Object</I> / <I>Save As</I> from the
<B>NetView</B> window and then enter the filename "myxor" in the filename
field of the popup before clicking <I>Ok</I>.  The program will actually
save the file as "myxor.net.gz"; the ".gz" suffix indicates that the
file has been compressed using <TT>`gzip'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
To restore the state of the simulation or some part of it, you can just
select <I>Object</I> / <I>Load</I> in the appropriate window.  This will load
the saved copy of the object over whatever is presently there,
effectively destroying whatever was there before.  When you first start
up the simulator, you can load a project by selecting <I>.project</I> /
<I>Open In</I> / <I>Root</I>.  This creates a project as a constituent of root
and loads the project saved in the file.

</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, once you've done whatever saving you want to do,
you can exit from the simulator by selecting <I>Object</I> / <I>Quit</I> from
the Root window.

</P>
<P>
Now you know how to run the software and you are done with
this part of the tutorial.  The next section of the tutorial steps
through the process of actually building a simulation from scratch
instead of loading a "canned" one in.
