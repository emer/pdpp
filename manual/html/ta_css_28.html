<H1><A NAME="IDX181" HREF="ta_css_toc.html">6  Programming with TypeAccess</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter contains some useful information for those who want to add
new functionality to the PDP++ software by compiling their own
executable.  By creating new subclasses of existing classes, and using
these new classes in your simulations, it should be possible to make
PDP++ do exactly what you want it to.

</P>
<P>
Before taking this step, you should be reasonably comfortable with the
CSS language and using it to access objects in the simulator.  Further,
you will need to know (or learn about) C++ in a bit more detail than is
covered in the CSS section of this manual.  There are a number of good
books on this subject available in most bookstores.

</P>
<P>
This chapter describes how to set up the makefiles in your own directory
where you will compile your executable.  It then describes various
coding conventions and extensions to the basic C++ language that we have
added to facilitate programming in PDP++.  We have established a standard
way of dealing with creating, copying, and deleting objects.  In
addition, each object has special functions that allow groups to manage
them.  All of these "coding conventions" are described in this chapter.

</P>
<P>
We have developed a run-time-type-information (RTTI) system called
TypeAccess, which provides type information about most classes at
run-time.  This can be used to determine what kind of unit a Unit*
object <EM>really</EM> is, for example (i.e., is it a BpUnit or a
MyWackyBpUnit?).  

</P>
<P>
The TypeAccess system requires a more complicated than normal set of
makefiles.  Fortunately, it is reasonably straightforward to use the
makefiles we have developed, so you won't have to deal with much of this
complexity. 

</P>
<P>
Most of the graphical interface (i.e., edit dialogs, menus, etc) is
generated automatically from the information provided by TypeAccess. The
same is true for the way you can transparently access hard-coded types
and objects through CSS.  Thus, you don't need to do anything special to
be able to use your newly defined classes exactly in the way that you
use the ones that come with the software.

</P>
<P>
There are some special keywords that you can put in the comments for
your classes and class members and methods called "comment directives".
These comment directives allow you to control various aspects of how the
GUI and CSS treat your objects.  These comment directives are described
in this chapter.
