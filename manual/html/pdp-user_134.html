<H2><A NAME="IDX756" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">10.8  Building Networks Using the Viewer</A></H2>

<P>
The network viewer (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_129.html">10.6  Network Viewer</A>) can be used to build networks
easily and rapidly.  The <I>Minor Action Buttons</I> in the action region
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_130.html">10.7.1  The Action Region</A>) in particular provide a series of actions
that can be performed on objects selected in the view region
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_132.html">10.7.3  The View Region</A>) that allow one to build the network.  Also note
that the tutorial covers some of the following material
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_34.html">4.3.2  Making a New Network</A>). 

</P>
<P>
The first step in building the network is creating the layers.  The
<I>New Layer(s)</I> button is highlighted when there are no layers in the
network, and it is usable when nothing else is selected.  It will prompt
for the number of layers to create.  After they are created, they show
up in the view region.  Note that they might appear off-screen depending
on how many were created, so you might have to hit the <I>Init</I> button
to see them all.

</P>
<P>
The <I>ReShape</I> button is used to shape layers into their desired size.
Note that the size of the layer is displayed in the coordinate area at
the very top of the "actions" region (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_130.html">10.7.1  The Action Region</A>).  The
default assumption of the software is to create as many units as will
fit in the shape of the layer (i.e., <CODE>n_units = X * Y</CODE>).  Whenever
you use <I>ReShape</I> and there are no units in the layer currently, it
will reset the <CODE>n_units</CODE> to fill the layer box completely. However,
if you use <I>ReShape</I> and there <EM>are</EM> units in the layer, the
value of <CODE>n_units</CODE> is not changed.  Note, however, that it will be
impossible to shape the layer to a size that is smaller than that which
will contain all of the existing units.  For more info on layer
parameters, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_115.html">10.2  Layers and Unit Groups</A>.

</P>
<P>
There are two ways of specifying a number of units that is less than the
size of the layer.  One is to select the layer box, at which time, if it
is empty, the <I>New Unit(s)</I> action button will become highlighted.
This action will prompt you for the number of units to create (the
default being the number that will fill the box completely).  By
entering a number that is less than this default value, you will
simultaneously create the units in the layer, and set the <CODE>n_units</CODE>
value to be that number.  Thus, any subsequent <CODE>Build</CODE> actions on
this layer will create that many units if they are not already there.

</P>
<P>
The units within the layer can be moved around.  However, they must stay
within the layer box.  Thus, you must reshape the layer to a larger size
if you wish to move the units beyond the box.

</P>
<P>
If the units within a layer are grouped into sub-groups, these
constitute a distinct selection level, so that all the units in the
group can be selected together.

</P>
<P>
Note that the <I>Build All</I> button is highlighted whenever there is a
layer that does not have its full complement of <CODE>n_units</CODE> units in
it.  Pressing <I>Build All</I> will create units in all the layers which
need them, and ensure that the units in the existing layers are of the
type specified in the <CODE>units</CODE> group on the layer.

</P>
<P>
After creating layers and units within them, the next step is to specify
the connectivity between layers.  Alternatively, though less commonly
(and more effortfully), connectivity can be specified on a unit-by-unit
basis.  This is covered later in this section.  As was discussed above
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_116.html">10.3  Projections</A>), it is easier to specify connectivity in terms of
projections between layers.

</P>
<P>
To create a new projection you select the <EM>receiving layer first</EM>.
Then, "extend" select the sending layer(s) (use the middle mouse button
or hold down the shift key while selecting, which adds the selected item
to the list of those things selected, instead of making it the only
thing selected).  The <I>New Prjn(s)</I> button will be highlighted, and
pressing it will create a projection into the first-selected receiving
layer from the subsequently selected sending layer(s).

</P>
<P>
Note that you can also create <EM>bi-directional projections</EM> instead.
Just use the <I>New BiPrjns</I> button instead of <I>New Prjn(s)</I>, and this
will create a reciprocal projection into the sending layer from the
receiving layer.

</P>
<P>
To <EM>self-connect</EM> a layer, simply select one layer, and press the
<I>New Self Prjn</I> button.

</P>
<P>
Just as with units in layers, one can create connections in projections
either all at once with the <I>Connect All</I> button, or individually by
selecting the projection and using the <I>Fill Prjn(s)</I> button, which
will be highlighted if the projection does not yet have any connections
associated with it.

</P>
<P>
To connect units on an individual basis, one simply selects the
receiving unit first and then the sending unit(s), and selects the
<I>Connect Units</I> button (or the <I>BiCon Units</I> to
bidirectionally-connect them).  The connections made in this way will be
associated with a <B>CustomPrjnSpec</B>, which basically just ensures that
the connectivity pattern will not be reset when the <I>Connect All</I>
button is pressed (i.e., it has no <CODE>Connect</CODE> function because the
connections are made one-by-one).

</P>
<P>
The specifications associated with the objects in the network can be
viewed and changed by using the <I>Selections</I> menu of the network
viewer.  This allows one to associate different parameters or types of
processing with different components of the network (e.g., projections
with different patterns of connectivity, units with different activation
functions or parameters, connections with different learning rates,
etc..)

</P>
<P>
Note that each layer has a default <B>UnitSpec</B> associated with it,
which is applied to any new units created in the layer or when <I>Build</I>
is performed.  Thus, if all of the units in the layer will be using the
same unit spec, it is a good idea to just select the layer itself and
then use <I>Selections/Set Unit Spec</I> to set the spec.  This will
automatically apply this spec to all of the units in the layer.

</P>
<P>
Also note that connection specifications (<B>ConSpec</B>s) are associated
with projections.  Thus, projections will be selected when
<I>Selections/Show Con Spec</I> is performed, and you should select
projections when doing the <I>Selections/Set Con Spec</I>.

</P>
<P>
Finally, all objects can be <I>Remove</I>d and <I>Edit</I>ed by selecting them
and pressing the appropriate action button.  When editing a group of
objects (i.e., after having multiply selected them and pressed
<I>Edit</I>), these objects should remain the only ones selected until the
dialog is either <I>Ok</I>ed or <I>Cancel</I>ed, since changing what is
selected affects what the edit dialog thinks its editing, and you won't
be able to <I>Apply</I> your editing changes if the selections change.
