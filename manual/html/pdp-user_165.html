</P>
<P>
Most <B>TrialProcess</B> objects are implemented to work with a particular
set of network objects that are part of a given algorithm.  Thus, the
<B>BpTrial</B> process expects to operate on <B>BpUnits</B> and <B>BpCon</B>s,
etc., and crashes otherwise.  This makes processing faster than if it
had to check the type of every object operated on every time it did a
computation.

</P>
<P>
This situation makes it difficult to implement hybrid networks which
combine components that operate under two different algorithms.  For
example, a self-organizing network can be used to pre-process inputs to
a backprop network.

</P>
<P>
The way to do solve this problem in PDP++ is to use a <B>BridgeProcess</B>,
in conjunction with a <B>SyncEpochProc</B> as described in the previous
section.  Thus, there are two trial processes that each operate
synchronously within an epoch on the same events.  The bridge process
copies activations or any other unit state variable from one network to
the other, allowing them to act as if they were a single composite
network.

</P>
<P>
An example of a bridge process can be found in the <TT>`demo/bridge'</TT>
directory.  This example just connects two backprop networks, but the
principles are the same when you use two different kinds of algorithms.

</P>
<P>
The parameters of the bridge process are as follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Network* second_network</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX982"></A>
This is the other network that is being bridged (the first network is
the one pointed to by the process <CODE>network</CODE> pointer).
<DT><CODE>BridgeDirection direction</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX983"></A>
This is the direction to copy--network one is the <CODE>network</CODE> pointer
and network two is the <CODE>second_network</CODE> pointer.  Note that the
<CODE>network</CODE> pointer is set by the process hierarchy that this process
is in, which means that it can't be set arbitrarily. This is why one
might need to switch the direction with this field.
<DT><CODE>String src_layer_nm</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX984"></A>
This is the name of the layer in the source network.  Only entire layers
can be copied with this process.
<DT><CODE>String trg_layer_nm</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX985"></A>
This is the name of the layer in the target network.
<DT><CODE>String src_variable</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX986"></A>
This is the variable name (e.g. "act") to copy from the unit.
<DT><CODE>String trg_variable</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX987"></A>
This is the variable to copy the value into.  Typically, this is "ext"
so that the input appears like external input to the unit, which will
then be treated appropriately by the processing algorithm.
<DT><CODE>Unit::ExtType trg_ext_flag</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX988"></A>
This sets the unit flag on the target units to indicate that external
input was received, if desired.  Note that the flag on the layer is
<EM>not</EM> set, which allows this external input to avoid being erased
by the <CODE>InitExterns</CODE> call which usually precedes application of
environmental patterns.
