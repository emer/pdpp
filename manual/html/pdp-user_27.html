<H3><A NAME="IDX28" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">4.2.7  Logging Training and Testing Data</A></H3>

<P>
Before we start to train our <B>Network</B>, and see if it can learn the
XOR problem, we will need a couple of tools for visualizing the
network's performance as it learns.  To allow for this, we have created
two objects called <B>Log</B>s, one for recording the state of various
network statistics and variables as they are computed during the
training process, and one for recording the activations of the hidden
and output units, when the network is tested with the learning process
switched off.  The data recorded in these logs are displayed in the
<B>GraphlogView</B> and the <B>GridLogView</B> respectively.  Double click on
both of these to open them up.

</P>
<P>
The <B>GraphLogView</B> is set to display the sum of the sum-squared-error
measure (<CODE>sum_sum_se</CODE>), summing over all output units and all of
the training patterns presented within each epoch.  The Epoch number
will be the X axis and the summed squared error will be the Y axis.
When we start to run the network this will be updated after every epoch
as we shall see.

</P>
<P>
The <B>GridLogView</B> is set to display detailed information about each
pattern whenever a special test process is run.  During the test, each
event in the environment is presented once, and the View displays the
epoch number, the Event name, the sum_squared error over all output
units (though in this case there is only one), and the activations of
the hidden and output units that occur when the input pattern associated
with this event is presented.
