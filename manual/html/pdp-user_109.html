<H3><A NAME="IDX522" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">9.5.2  Project Object Defaults (TypeDefaults)</A></H3>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>.defaults</CODE> group on the Project object contains a number of
objects called <B>TypeDefault</B>s.  These objects can represent the
default values of fields within a whole range of possible objects that
could be created in the project.  These defaults are used to make sure
that the appropriate types of objects are created for particular
algorithms.  This is done through the use of default files, which are
saved groups of TypeDefault objects.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX526"></A>
There are a number of different default files saved in the
<TT>`defaults'</TT> directory, one of which is automatically loaded into the
<CODE>.defaults</CODE> group of the project when it is created.  Which one is
used is based on the name of the PDP++ executable (i.e., bp.def for
bp++).  When PDP++ starts, it checks the name of the executable, and
puts the appropriate defaults file name in the <CODE>default_file</CODE>
field of the PDPRoot object.  Changing this field will change the
default file that will be used when a new project is created.

</P>
<P>
The user can create their own defaults files, to have things
come up just the way they like them.  It is recommended that you start
with the basic defaults appropriate to a given algorithm that you will
be using.  Simply edit an existing or create a new <B>TypeDefault</B>
object in the <CODE>.defaults</CODE> group of a project that has the right
initial defaults in it.  There is one <B>TypeDefault</B> object for each
different type or class of object whose default values are being set.
Derived classes (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_88.html">8.1.1  What is an Object?</A>) automatically inherit default
values set on parent classes.

</P>
<P>
The TypeDefault object has the following members:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX527"></A>
<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TypeDef* default_type</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
This is where you pick the type of object you want to set the default
values of.  Note that many types are descended from <B>taNBase</B>, so look
in its submenu.  Be sure to press <I>Apply</I> after selecting a type, so
that the object knows what type of <CODE>token</CODE> to make.

<DT><CODE>TAPtr token</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX530"></A>
This field contains a token of the type selected in <CODE>default_type</CODE>
(remember to hit <I>Apply</I> first before editing this!).  Default values
are set by simply editing this object and setting the values of the
fields as you want them to be by default.  Only those fields that have a
check in the leftmost checkbox next to the field will have default
values saved.  Thus, make sure that box is checked when you make changes
to the fields.  Then, <I>Ok</I> the dialog, and be sure to hit <I>Apply</I> on
the <B>TypeDefault</B> object itself.  This causes the specific changes you
specified to be registered in the <CODE>active_membs</CODE> group, which only
records the values of those members that were checked.

<DT><CODE>taBase_Group active_membs</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX531"></A>
The type default values are actually saved as name-value pairs (using
the <B>NameValue</B> object), where the name is the name of the member, and
the value is a string representation of its value.  This is a group of
such name-value pairs for the checked fields.  While you can enter
things directly in here, it is recommended that you use the
<CODE>token</CODE> to do it instead.

</DL>

<P>
When you have created a set of defaults, save them using the <I>Save
As/All</I> menu item in the <CODE>.defaults</CODE> group.  If you have the
appropriate permissions, it is easier to put the defaults file in the
global <TT>`/usr/local/pdp++/defaults'</TT> directory.  However, it is
cleaner to keep your defaults in your own directory.  Since your home
directory is searched automatically for default files, you could put the
default files there.  A better solution is to create a special
directory to hold your defaults, and add this directory to your
<CODE>include_path</CODE> in your <TT>`.pdpinitrc'</TT> file
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_108.html">9.5.1  Settings and the .pdpinitrc and .cssinitrc Files</A>).
