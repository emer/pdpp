One of the important design considerations for the PDP++ software was the
idea that one should separate state variables from specifications and
parameters (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_11.html">3.3  Separation of State from Specification Variables</A>).  The attributes of an object can often
be divided into two types--the first type of attributes represent the
object's state. These change over time and are usually distinct within
each instance of an object.  The second group of attributes represent
parameters of an object that tend to remain fixed over time, and often
have values that are common among instances of the object class. This
second group can be thought of as a <STRONG>specification</STRONG> for the
object class.

</P>
<P>
For example: The car object class might have two attributes: color, and
current-speed. The color attribute would be set when the car was built,
and would (hopefully) not be changing very much. It would be classified
as a specification parameter. The current-speed attribute is likely to
be constantly changing as the car accelerates and decelerates. It is
representative of the car's current state and would be classified in the
first group, the car's state space. If you took a group of cars, chances
are that some of them would share the same color, but they would
probably be moving around at different speeds. Rather than have each car
carry around an attribute for its color, the specification attributes
are split off from the car and put into a special class called a
car-specification or carspec. In this way cars with identical colors can
share the same specification, while still having their own state
attributes like current-speed.  By changing the color attribute in the
specification, all the cars sharing that specification would have their
color changed. This allows easy access to common parameters of an object
class in one location. Rather than individually setting the color
parameter for each instance of a car, the attribute can be set in just
once in the spec.

This idea is instantiated in a particular class of objects known as
<B>Spec</B>s.  Specs also have special "smart pointers" that objects use to
refer to them.  These spec pointers or <B>SPtr</B> objects ensure that a
given object always has a corresponding spec, and that this spec is of
an appropriate type.

</P>
<P>
While specs are basically just classes that have parameters and
functions that control other object's behavior, there are a couple of
special properties that specs have which make them more powerful.

</P>
<P>
Often when one wants to use two different specs of the same type, it is
because one spec has one parameter different than the other.  For
example, one spec might specify a learning rate of .01, and the other a
learning rate of .001.  However, these specs might very well share
several other parameters.

To simplify the ability of specs to share some parameters and not
others, a special system of <EM>spec inheritance</EM> was developed.
Basically, each spec has a group on it called <CODE>children</CODE>, in which
"child" specs can be created.  These child specs inherit all of their
parameters from the parent spec, except those specifically marked as
unique to the child.  These fields appear with a check in the left-hand
check-box when edited in the GUI.  Thus, whenever you change a value in
the parent, the children automatically get this changed value, except if
they have a unique value for this field, in which case they keep their
current value.  For a tutorial demonstration of how this works, see
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_39.html">4.3.7  Training and Testing Your Network</A>).

There are a couple of things to know about the "smart" spec pointers.
These pointers have both a type field and the actual pointer to the
spec.  When you change only the <CODE>type</CODE> field, it will automatically
find a spec of that type, and set the pointer to that.  If one does not
yet exist, one will be created automatically and the pointer set to it.
If however you change the pointer directly to point to a different spec,
and this spec is of a different type than that shown in the <CODE>type</CODE>
field, then the type will prevail over the pointer you set.  Thus you
have to change both the <CODE>type</CODE> and <CODE>spec</CODE> fields if you change
the latter to point to a different type.

</P>
<P>
The reason for this is that the spec pointer object does not know which
field you actually changed, and for the nice automatic properties
associated with changing the type field to work, the need to update both
the type and the spec pointer is an unfortunate consequence.
