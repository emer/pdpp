<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>#HIDDEN</CODE>
<DD>
Hides member from user's view in edit dialogs and CSS type information
printouts. 
<DT><CODE>#HIDDEN_INLINE</CODE>
<DD>
Hides member when inlined in another object, but not when edited itself.
This only applies to members of #INLINE objects.
<DT><CODE>#SHOW</CODE>
<DD>
Always show this member in the edit dialog (i.e., even if it was marked
#READ_ONLY).
<DT><CODE>#IGNORE</CODE>
<DD>
Does not register this member in the type information for this class.
<DT><CODE>#DETAIL</CODE>
<DD>
Flags this member as a level of detail that the user usually does not
need to deal with -- can be viewed by changing the Show setting in the
edit dialog.
<DT><CODE>#NO_SAVE</CODE>
<DD>
This member is not saved when dumping to a file.
<DT><CODE>#NO_SAVE_PATH_R</CODE>
<DD>
Don't create these objects in the 1st pass of the dump file (e.g., they
will be created automatically by something else, usually an
#IMMEDIATE_UPDATE UpdateAfterEdit function on a parent object).  This
can be used to speed up saving and loading of large numbers of
repetitive objects which can be created instead.
<DT><CODE>#READ_ONLY</CODE>
<DD>
Allows the user to see but not edit this item.  By default the gui edit
dialog will not show these items.  This prevents the member from being
changed in CSS as well.
<DT><CODE>#IV_READ_ONLY</CODE>
<DD>
Like READ_ONLY, but user can modify the value via CSS (which is
prevented by READ_ONLY).
<DT><CODE>#LIST_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
Sets the Lookup List for this element.  This is used mainly for pointers
to functions, where one wants the gui to show a list of top-level
functions that have been scanned by maketa (see section <A HREF="ta_css_40.html">6.3.4  Top-Level Function Directives</A>).
<DT><CODE>#TYPE_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
Sets the default type for members which are pointers to TypeDef objects.
This also works for MemberDef pointers.  If xxx is 'this', then the 
type of the current object is used.
<DT><CODE>#TYPE_ON_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
For object, TypeDef, or MemberDef pointers: use member xxx of this
object to anchor the listing of possible types, tokens, or members.
<DT><CODE>#FROM_GROUP_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
For token pointers, use given member xxx as the group from which to
select token options (xxx can be a pointer to a group).
<DT><CODE>#GROUP_OPT_OK</CODE>
<DD>
For FROM_GROUP_xxx mbrs, allows group itself as an option (else not
allowed).
<DT><CODE>#SUBTYPE_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
Sets this token pointer member to be only subitems (objects owned by
this one) of type xxx.  A recursive scan of members on this object is
performed to search for objects of the given type as possible values for
this field.
<DT><CODE>#NO_SUBTYPE</CODE>
<DD>
Don't search this ptr for possible subitems (use if this ptr might point
"up", causing a endless loop of searching for subitems).
<DT><CODE>#NO_FIND</CODE>
<DD>
Don't search this member for the recursive FindMembeR function which
searches recursively through objects (use if this ptr might point up in
the hierarchy, which might cause an endless loop).
<DT><CODE>#NO_SCOPE</CODE>
<DD>
Don't use scope for tokens for a token pointer member.  See SCOPE object directive
<DT><CODE>#LABEL_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
Set the label for item (or menu or button) to be xxx.
<DT><CODE>#OWN_POINTER</CODE>
<DD>
For a pointer to an object, when loading, set the owner of the obj to be
this object.  Thus, this pointer is always created and owned by this
object. 
<DT><CODE>#NULL_OK</CODE>
<DD>
A null value is ok as an option for the user (else not) for pointer to a
type, and SUBTYPE tokens.
<DT><CODE>#NO_NULL</CODE>
<DD>
A null value is not ok (for tokens) (else ok).
<DT><CODE>#NO_EDIT</CODE>
<DD>
Don't include Edit as an option on a token pointer menu (else ok).
<DT><CODE>#POS_ONLY</CODE>
<DD>
Only positive (non-negative) integers, this controls behavior of the
stepper for integer types.
<DT><CODE>#LINK_GROUP</CODE>
<DD>
This group member only has linked items (doesn't allow user to create
new tokens in this group).
<DT><CODE>#IN_GPMENU</CODE>
<DD>
This members' items should appear in the group menu. The member must be
a <B>taGroup_impl</B> descendent type, and the class must have a
MEMB_IN_GPMENU option set.
<DT><CODE>#CONDEDIT_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
This makes editing a member conditional on the value of another member.
For example: #CONDEDIT_OFF_type:NONE,LT_MAX specifies that this member
is to be not editable (OFF) when the type enum variable is either NONE
or LT_MAX.  One alternatively specify ON for conditions when it should
be editable.  The comparison is based on the string representation of
the member value -- sub-paths to members within contained objects can
also be used.
<DT><CODE>#DEF_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
Specifies a default value for the member.  If the field is set to a
value other than this default value, it will be highlighted in yellow to
indicate that the value is different from default.  This should only be
used where there are clear default values that are typically not
changed.
<DT><CODE>#AKA_xxx</CODE>
<DD>
This allows old project files etc to be loaded correctly after changing
the name of a field or enum by matching xxx to the new field/enum.
