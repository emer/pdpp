In PDP++ the hierarchy of objects provides the basis for most of the gui
(Graphical User Interface) interaction. To access a sub-object of a
class, the best place to start is with the gui window for the parent
class instance and work your way down to the sub-object. The higher
levels of the hierarchy have windows which are mapped to the screen when
the object is created. These windowing objects inherit from the base
class <B>WinBase</B>. When PDP++ starts up, only one of these classes has
been created and thus there is only one window on the screen. The
initial object is an instance of the class PDPRoot, and is the top of
the PDP hierarchy.
