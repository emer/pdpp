<H3><A NAME="IDX190" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">7.3.1  Differences Between CSS and C++</A></H3>

<P>
The primary difference between CSS and C++ is that CSS does not support
the complex set of rules which determine which of a set of functions
with the same name should be called given a particular set of arguments.
Thus, CSS does not allow multiple functions with the same name.  By
avoiding the function-call resolution problems, CSS is much faster and
smaller than it otherwise would be.

</P>
<P>
One consequence of the lack of name resolution is that only default (no
argument) constructors can be defined.  This also obviates the need for
the special parent-constructor calling syntax.

</P>
<P>
Also, at the present time, CSS does not support the definition of
<CODE>operator</CODE> member functions that redefine the operation of the
various arithmetic operators.  Further, it does not provide access
control via the <CODE>private</CODE>, <CODE>public</CODE>, and <CODE>protected</CODE>
keywords, or the <CODE>const</CODE> type control, though these are parsed (and
ignored).  Thus, it also does not deal with the <CODE>friend</CODE> constructs
either.  While these language features could be added, they do not make
a great deal of sense for the interactive script-level programming that
CSS is designed to handle.

</P>
<P>
CSS <EM>does</EM> support multiple inheritance, and the overloading of
derived member functions.  It does not support the inlining of
functions, which is a compiler-level optimization anyway.  The keyword
<CODE>inline</CODE> will be parsed, but ignored.

</P>
<P>
Also, note that CSS gives one access to hard-coded classes and types
(via TypeAccess), in addition to those defined in the script.

</P>
<P>
Templates are not supported for script-based classes, but are supported
in hard-coded classes (via TypeAccess).

</P>
<P>
Exception handling is not supported, and probably will not be.

</P>
<P>
Since the primary use of CSS is for relatively simple pieces of code
that glue together more complex hard-coded objects, and not implementing
large programs, the present limitations of CSS will probably not affect
most users.

</P>
