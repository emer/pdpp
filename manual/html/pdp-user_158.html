The <B>TrialProcess</B> executes a single trial of processing, which
corresponds to the presentation of a single <B>Event</B> to the network.
This process is never used in its base form.  Instead, different
algorithms derive versions of this process which perform
algorithm-specific computations.

The trial process obtains the current event to be processed from the
epoch process, which it finds somewhere above it in the processing
hierarchy.  It keeps a pointer to this event in its own <CODE>cur_event</CODE>
member.  It also typically depends on the epoch process <CODE>wt_update</CODE>
field to determine if it should be computing weight changes or just
testing the network.

</P>
<P>
Some types of <B>TrialProcess</B> objects are terminal levels in the
processing hierarchy, since they perform all of the basic computations
directly on the network.  This is true of feedforward backpropagation,
for example (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_202.html">14.1.4  The Bp Trial Process</A>).  However, other types of trial process
have sub-processes which perform iterative setting and cycling
processes, which are described below.  This is true of the constraint
satisfaction trial process, for example (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_221.html">15.4  Cs Proceses</A>).
