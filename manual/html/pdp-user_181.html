Logs provide a convenient method of recording information from the
processes. This information can be as simple as the epoch number of
training or as complicated as a multi-variable statistic. In PDP++
logs are stored on the Project, and pointed to by a process. Like the
network, logs may have many views.  Logs are color-coded brown in the
default color scheme (get it?).

</P>
<P>
Processes interface with a log by sending it both header and data
information. The header information provides the labels for the columns
of data. Each line of data provides a row of information for each of the
fields in header line.

</P>
<P>
Logs can record data to log files, which contain columns and rows of
data in text format.  Each line of the log file contains an identifier
that indicates the name of the process which generated the data (or
just _H:) if there is only one updating process. At the start of a log
file, a row of header information is recorded, which identifies the
data in the columns.  Both of these identifiers can be removed with
the shell script <TT>`bin/getlogdata'</TT>, which strips them from the
file, and writes a new file with a <TT>`.logd'</TT> extension.

</P>
<P>
Note that the log data file is distinct from the object save file,
which will save the parameters associated with the log object, but not
the data in the log itself.  Thus, projects do not save any current
log data.  It has to be specifically saved in a log file.  Functions
to save and load log files are found in the <CODE>Logfile</CODE> menu.

</P>
<P>
Also, the log object maintains an internal buffer of log data (the size
of which can be set by editing the log, see next section).  This buffer
can be directly accessed through the script language to perform various
data analysis operations.
