The Connection class contains the weights which represent the strengths
of the relationship between units.  Since there are typically many more
connections than any other type of object in a simulation, these objects
are treated specially to speed up processing speed and reduce their
memory consumption.

</P>
<P>
The main way in which connections are different than other objects, like
Units, for example, is that they are usually operated on in a group.
Thus, the <B>Con_Group</B> class becomes very important to determining how
connections behave, which is not the case with a <B>Unit_Group</B>, for
example.

</P>
<P>
The <B>Con_Group</B>, and not each connection, contains a pointer to the
<B>ConSpec</B> which governs the behavior of all of the connections in the
group.  Also, <B>Con_Group</B>s can contain algorithm-specific parameters,
and in general algorithms define their own type of <B>Con_Group</B>.  When
connections are created by projections, a new <B>Con_Group</B> is created
to hold all of the connections for each projection.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX694"></A>
The basic <B>Connection</B> class (which is often abbreviated <B>Con</B> when
new types are defined based on it, e.g. <B>BpCon</B>) has only the weight
value, <CODE>wt</CODE>.  Other algorithms will add other variables as needed.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX695"></A>
The basic <B>ConSpec</B> connection specification has parameters for
determining how a connection's weights are to be initialized.  The
<CODE>rnd</CODE> field, which is of type <B>Random</B> (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_101.html">8.5  Random Distributions</A>),
allows for weights to be initialized with random values.  To get a
specific weight value, use <CODE>UNIFORM</CODE> with a <CODE>mean</CODE> of the
value you want and a <CODE>var</CODE> of zero.  The <CODE>NONE</CODE> type of
randomization will simply not do anything to the weight value.  Note
that this may be ignored if the <B>ProjectionSpec</B> which created the
connections has its <CODE>init_wts</CODE> flag set (but most projection specs
just use the ConSpec initialization anyway) (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_116.html">10.3  Projections</A>).

</P>

Each ConSpec also has a WeightLimit object which controls how the
weights are constrained. This object has <VAR>min</VAR> and <VAR>max</VAR> fields
and a controling field called <VAR>type</VAR> which can have the following
values: 
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>NONE</CODE>
<DD>
no weight limitations (default).
<DT><CODE>GT_MIN</CODE>
<DD>
constrain weights to be greater than min value.
<DT><CODE>LT_MAX</CODE>
<DD>
constrain weights to be less than max value.
<DT><CODE>MIN_MAX</CODE>
<DD>
constrain weights to be within min and max values.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX701"></A>
<A NAME="IDX702"></A>
<A NAME="IDX703"></A>
In addition the ConSpec has a boolean field called <VAR>sym</VAR> which
if true, symmetrizes (sets to the same value) the initial weights
across two different connections that reciprocally connect the same two
units.

</P>
<P>
The <B>ConSpec</B> is the place to look for parameters that determine how
weights are updated, for example learning rate, etc.  These are all
defined in algorithm-specific versions of the ConSpec.

</P>

Note: the following information should be useful to those who wish to
program in PDP++, but is not necessary for the average user to
understand.
