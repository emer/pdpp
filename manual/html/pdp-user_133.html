The Scale Region is on the right edge of the NetView. At the top of the
scale region is the Unit Text selector. This menu allows the user to
directly access the NetView's <CODE>unit_text</CODE> member which controls
whether or not unit names and/or values are displayed on the units.

</P>
<P>
Next is the display mode selector, which directly accesses the
<CODE>shape</CODE> member of the NetView, controlling how the unit values are
displayed.

</P>
<P>
Beneath this is the Auto Scale toggle. When the Auto Scale toggle is on,
the values of the scalebar adjust to the positive and negative range of
the the maximum of the value of the field selected in the Member Region.
When the Auto Scale toggle is off, the up and down arrow buttons above
and below the scalebar can be used to increase or decrease the range of
the scale respectively. This can be used to "zoom" in on the differences
between unit or connection values. In addition the user can click the
mouse in the number region of the scalebar and type in the precise scale
range by hand if so desired. The colors in the colorscale are determined
by the <CODE>colorspec</CODE> field of the NetView.
