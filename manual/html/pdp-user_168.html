<H3><A NAME="IDX1012" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">12.7.1  Aggregation Operators and other Parameters</A></H3>

<P>
For both the <CODE>time_agg</CODE> and the <CODE>net_agg</CODE> members of a stat,
the following aggregation operators are defined:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1013"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>LAST</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1014"></A>
This simply copies the last value seen.  This is useful for aggregators
that appear in the train and batch levels of processing, which typically
just reflect the results of the most recent epoch of processing.  In the
network-level aggregation, this would give the value of the last unit,
which is not terribly useful.
<DT><CODE>SUM</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1015"></A>
This sums over all values.
<DT><CODE>PROD</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1016"></A>
This gives a product over all values.  When this operator is used, the
result variable will be initialized to 1.
<DT><CODE>MIN</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1017"></A>
This gives the minimum value of all seen.  Note that when this is the
aggregation operator, the result variable will be initialized to a very
large number.
<DT><CODE>MAX</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1018"></A>
This gives the maximum value of all seen.  Note that when this is the
aggregation operator, the result variable will be initialized to a very
small number.
<DT><CODE>AVG</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1019"></A>
This gives the average of all values seen.  Since aggregation happens
on-line, we use the on-line version of averaging, so the result is
always the average of what has been seen so far.
<DT><CODE>COPY</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1020"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1021"></A>
This results in the collection of individual values, which are kept in
the <CODE>copy_vals</CODE> group of the stat.  Thus, it does not form a single
summary number of all the values, instead it simply copies them
verbatim.  This is useful for <B>MonitorStat</B> objects, which copy state
variables from the network.  It can be used to view per-event values at
the end of the epoch by doing a <CODE>time_agg</CODE> with the <CODE>COPY</CODE>
operator.
<DT><CODE>COUNT</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1022"></A>
This counts up the the number of times the values meet the comparison
expression given in the <CODE>count</CODE> field of the agg member.  The count
expression has relational operators and a comparison value, so one could
for example count the number of times an error value was below some
threshold.
</DL>

<P>
In addition to the aggregation operator, the <CODE>time_agg</CODE> member has
a pointer to the stat that this stat is aggregating <CODE>from</CODE>.  If
this is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, then the stat is computing original information
instead of aggregating.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1023"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1024"></A>
It is possible to control when the stat is computed, and if the data is
logged, independently.  The <CODE>mod</CODE> member of a stat determines when
and if it is computed (and when its criterion is checked, when it is
logged, etc).  For stats located in the <CODE>loop_stats</CODE> group, this
mod operator works on the process whose loop_stats the stat is in.  For
stats located in the <CODE>final_stats</CODE> group, the mod operator works on
the next higher up process in the hierarchy (i.e., a stat in the
final_stats of a TrialProcess would use the trial counter from the
parent EpochProcess).  The <CODE>log_stat</CODE> flag provides a way of
turning on or off the logging of a statistic.  If the flag is not
checked, a stat is not logged, but it is run and its criterion is
checked (as per the mod settings).  Thus, one can keep lower-level stats
which might be just collecting data for aggregation from generating too
much log data.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1025"></A>
Finally, the computation of the stat over the objects in the network can
be restricted to a given layer by setting the <CODE>layer</CODE> pointer.  The
layer name will also appear in the stat log output and in the name field
of the stat itself.
