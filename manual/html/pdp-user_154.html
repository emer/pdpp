The <B>BatchProcess</B> iterates over the training of networks.  This is
useful in determining the average learning time for a given problem with
different random initial weights, for example.  The batch process has a
<CODE>batch</CODE> counter object, which records the number of networks that
have been trained so far.  The appropriate sub-process type for a batch
process is a <B>TrainProcess</B>, though it is possible to have multiple
batch processes before the train process, in order to have multiple
loops of network training (presumably with some parameter manipulation
in between).

There is a built-in batch process type that makes it easy to perform
simple searches of parameter space called the <B>GridSearchBatch</B>.  This
process increments a single parameter value in step with the batch
counter, and applies this value to any parameter of the user's choosing.
The parameter to be modified is specified by giving a CSS-style path to
that parameter from the common project object (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_69.html">7.2.3  Accessing Hard-Coded Objects in CSS</A>
for details).  An example project which uses this grid search batch is
<TT>`demo/bp/gridsearch_xor.proj.gz'</TT>, which can be consulted to see how
it works in practice.  It also records the current value of the
parameter to the log file.
