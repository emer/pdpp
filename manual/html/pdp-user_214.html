<H3><A NAME="IDX1314" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">14.2.7  The Almeida-Pineda Algorithm in RBp</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1315"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1316"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1318"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1319"></A>

</P>
<P>
The Almeida-Pineda backprop (APBp) algorithm is a lot like the recurrent
backpropagation algorithm just described, except that instead of
recording the activation trajectory over time, and the backpropagating
back through it, this algorithm performs activation propagation until
the change in activation goes below some threshold, and then it performs
backpropagation repeatedly until the change in error derivatives also
goes below threshold.

</P>
<P>
This algorithm is implemented by using the standard RBp unit and
connection types, even though APBp doesn't require the activation trace
that is kept by these units.  Indeed, you should set the
<CODE>store_states</CODE> flag on the <B>RBpUnitSpec</B> to <CODE>false</CODE> when
using APBp.

</P>
<P>
The only thing that is needed is a set of processes to implement the
settling process over cycles of activation and error propagation.  Thus,
three new processes were implemented, including a cycle process
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_160.html">12.5.3  Performing one Update: CycleProcess</A>) to perform one cycle of activation or error
propagation, a settle process (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_159.html">12.5.2  Iterating over Cycles: SettleProcess</A>) to iterate
over cycles, and a train process (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_155.html">12.4.2  Iterating over Epochs: TrainProcess</A>) to iterate
over two phases of settling (activation and backpropagation).

</P>
<P>
The <B>APBpCycle</B> and <B>APBpSettle</B> processes don't have any
user-settable parameters.  The <B>APBpTrial</B> adds a couple of options to
control settling:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1320"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Counter phase_no</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1321"></A>
The counter that controls what phase the process is in.
<DT><CODE>Phase phase</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1322"></A>
The phase, which is either <CODE>ACT_PHASE</CODE> or <CODE>BP_PHASE</CODE>.
It is essentially just a more readable version of the phase_no counter.
<DT><CODE>StateInit trial_init</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1323"></A>
Determines what to do at the start of settling.  One can either
<CODE>DO_NOTHING</CODE> or <CODE>INIT_STATE</CODE>, which initializes the unit
activation state variables, and is the default thing to do.
<DT><CODE>bool no_bp_stats</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1324"></A>
This flag, if set, does not collect any statistics during the Bp phase
of settling.
<DT><CODE>bool no_bp_test</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1325"></A>
This flag, if set, means that no backpropagation settling phase will be
computed if the epoch process is in <CODE>TEST</CODE> <CODE>wt_update</CODE> mode.
</DL>

<P>
The threshold that determines when the settling is cut off is determined
by a <B>APBpMaxDa_De</B> statistic object, which measures the maximum
change in activation or the maximum change in error derivative.  The
stopping criterion (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_169.html">12.7.2  Using Statistics to Control Process Execution</A>) of this stat determines the
cutoff threshold.  It assumes that the same threshold is used for
activation as is used for error, which seems to be reasonable in
practice.
