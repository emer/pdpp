Every time the PDP++ software starts up, it looks for a
<TT>`.cssinitrc'</TT> and a <TT>`.pdpinitrc'</TT> file in the user's home
directory.  These files contain CSS script code that can set various
default settings, set aliases for CSS commands, etc (see also
section <A HREF="pdp-user_78.html">7.4.3  CSS Startup options</A>).  A list of the different settings that can be put
into the <TT>`.pdpinitrc'</TT> file is given in section <A HREF="pdp-user_58.html">6.17  Settings Affecting GUI Behavior</A>.  These
settings are actually "static" members located in the <B>taMisc</B> object,
and are set in CSS as in the following example:

</P>
<PRE>taMisc::display_width = 90;
</PRE>

<P>
Another thing that you might want to put in the <TT>`.pdpinitrc'</TT> is
your default color specification:

</P>
<PRE>.colorspecs.SetDefaultElName("C_ColdHot");
</PRE>

<P>

<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
Finally, if you have put a set of PDP++ files (like the defaults files
described in the next section, for example) in a directory somewhere,
you can add this directory to the list of those automatically searched
when loading CSS script files and defaults files.  This is done with the
<CODE>include_paths</CODE> member of the <B>taMisc</B> object that holds all of
the other settings parameters.  It is an array of strings, and you
simply add a new string to it to add a new path:

</P>
<PRE>taMisc::include_paths.AddUnique("/home/mach/me/pdp++/defaults");
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX522"></A>
Note that the environmental variable <CODE>PDPDIR</CODE> should be set to the
directory in which PDP++ was installed in order to have the default
include paths be correct.  If <CODE>PDPDIR</CODE> is not set, the default is
<TT>`/usr/local/pdp++'</TT>.
