<H2><A NAME="IDX871" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">11.11  Other Environment Types</A></H2>

<P>
There are a couple of other types of environments that embelish the
basic model described above.  Two of these are particularly appropriate
for specific algorithms, and are therefore described in the context of
these algorithms.  Thus, for information on the environment types that
associate a particular time with each event (<B>TimeEnvironment</B>,
<B>TimeEvent_MGroup</B>, and <B>TimeEvent</B>), see the recurrent
backpropagation part of the manual: section <A HREF="pdp-user_212.html">14.2.5  RBp Sequence Processes and TimeEvents</A>.  However, note that
the <B>CsSettle</B> process (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_221.html">15.4  Cs Proceses</A>) will use the <CODE>time</CODE>
value for determining how long to settle, which is different from the
way this variable is used in RBp.  For information about the environment
types that allow individual patterns within an event to be chosen
probabilistically (<B>ProbEventSpec</B>, <B>ProbPatternSpec_Group</B>,
<B>PropPattern</B>), see the constraint satisfaction part of the manual:
section <A HREF="pdp-user_227.html">15.7  The Probability Environment and Cs</A>.

The <B>XYPattern</B> and <B>XYPatternSpec</B> provide a mechanism for applying
patterns that move around on a larger input layer.  The offset of a
pattern is specified by the <CODE>offset</CODE> member of the pattern, which
can be updated (e.g., by a script) to move the pattern around on
subsequent pattern presentations.  The pattern spec provides options to
determine the way in which the pattern is applied to a network layer:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX873"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>bool wrap</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX874"></A>
This controls whether to wrap the pattern around the network layer if it
should extend beyond the maximum coordinate for the layer in either the
x or y dimension.  The alternative is that it is "clipped" at the
maximum, and that portion of the pattern is simply not presented.
<DT><CODE>bool apply_background</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX875"></A>
The portions of the network layer which do not receive input from the
pattern can optionally be set to a particular "background" level, by
setting this flag.
<DT><CODE>float background_value</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX876"></A>
This is the value to set the background units to, if applicable.

The <B>ScriptEnv</B> is an environment with a script associated with it.
The script is called at the beginning of the epoch, when the
<B>EpochProcess</B> calls the <CODE>InitEvents</CODE> function on the
environment.  The <B>ScriptEnv</B> defines this function to run its
script, which can contain code to build an entire epoch's worth of
events dynamically (i.e., as the epoch is starting).  This is useful
for environments which have a probabalistic character which is more
complicated than simple frequency sampling.  An example of a
<B>ScriptEnv</B> is provided in the demo of a simple recurrent network,
which learns to perform like a finite state automaton.  The training
events are generated probabalistically at run-time using a
<B>ScriptEnv</B> from a script version of the automaton.  This demo can
be found in the <TT>`demo/bp_srn'</TT> directory.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX878"></A>
Note that the <B>ScriptEnv</B>, like other script-based objects, provides
an array of script args called <CODE>s_args</CODE> that can be used to control
the behavior of the script and customize it for particular cases.  The
meaning of these arguments depends of course on the script that is being
used, but they should be documented near the top of the script code.

The <B>InteractiveScriptEnv</B> is a script environment that works with
the interactive model of event construction (See
section <A HREF="pdp-user_136.html">11.1  Environments</A> and section <A HREF="pdp-user_163.html">12.6.2  Processes for Interactive Environments</A>).  The script is called
when the <B>InteractiveEpoch</B> calls <CODE>GetNextEvent</CODE> on the
environment, at the start of each trial.  At this point, the script
should generate a new event (based on the network's output to the
prior event, for example), and set the <CODE>next_event</CODE> pointer to
point to this event.  If the epoch is over, then next_event should be
set to NULL.  The script can examine the <CODE>event_ctr</CODE> variable on
the environment to determine where it is within the epoch -- this
value is reset to 0 at the start of the epoch.

</P>
<P>
For a working example of this technology, see
<TT>`demo/leabra/nav.proj.gz'</TT> and its associated <TT>`nav_env.css'</TT>
script which is attached to an InteractiveScriptEnv.

The <B>FromFileEnv</B> environment reads events one epoch of
<CODE>events_per_epc</CODE> events (<CODE>read_mode = ONE_EPOCH</CODE>) or one
single event (<CODE>ONE_EVENT</CODE>) at a time from a file (either text or
binary format) for presentation to the network.  This should be useful
for very large environments or very large patterns, or both.  Note
that events_per_epc events will be loaded into RAM at a time from the
file, so this number should not be set too large relative to available
memory, etc.  Reading one event at a time (ONE_EVENT -- only one event
in RAM at any time) uses the "interactive" interface to the
environment (GetNextEvent) meaning that the <B>InteractiveEpoch</B> epoch
process (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_163.html">12.6.2  Processes for Interactive Environments</A>) must be used.
