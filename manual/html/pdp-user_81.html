The following are the commands available in CSS.  Commands are a little
bit "special" in that they are typically executed immediately, they can
be called with arguments without using the parentheses required in
normal C functions (though they can be used if desired), and they do not
need to be terminated with a semicolon (note that this also means that
commands cannot extend across more than one line).  Also, they do not
generate return values.  In general, commands provide debugging and
program management (loading, listing, etc) kinds of facilities.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>alias &#60;cmd&#62; &#60;new_nm&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
Gives a new name to an existing command.  This is useful for defining
shortcuts (e.g., <CODE>alias list ls</CODE>), but does not allow more complex
functionality.  For that, either define a new function, or use a
pre-processor <CODE>#define</CODE> macro.
<DT><CODE>chsh &#60;script_path&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
Switches the CSS interface to access the CSS script object pointed to by
the given path.  This is for hard-coded objects that have CSS script
objects in them (of type <CODE>cssProgSpace</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>clearall</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
Clears out everything from the current program space.  This is like
restarting the CSS shell, compared to <CODE>reset</CODE> which does not remove
any variables defined at the top-level.
<DT><CODE>commands</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
Shows a list of the currently available commands (including any aliases
that have been defined, which will appear at the end of the list).
<DT><CODE>constants</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
Shows a list of the pre-defined constants that have been defined in CSS.
These are just like globally-defined <CODE>Int</CODE> and <CODE>Real</CODE> values,
and thus they can be assigned to different values (though this is
obviously not recommended).
<DT><CODE>cont</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
Continues the execution of a program that was stopped either by a
breakpoint or by single-stepping.  To continue at a particular line in
the code, use the <CODE>goto</CODE> command.
<DT><CODE>debug &#60;level&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
Sets the debug level.  Level 1 provides a trace of the source lines
executed.  Level 2 provides a more detailed, machine-level trace, and
causes <CODE>list</CODE> to show the program at the machine level instead of
at the usual source level. Levels greater than 2 provide increasing
amounts of detail about the inner workings of CSS, which should not be
relevant to most users.
<DT><CODE>define</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
Toggles the mode where statements that are typed in become part of the
current program to be executed later (define mode), as opposed the
default (run mode) where statements are executed immediately after entering
them.
<DT><CODE>defines</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>
Shows a list of all of the current <CODE>#define</CODE> pre-processor macros.
<DT><CODE>edit &#60;object&#62; [&#60;wait&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
If the GUI (graphical user interface) is active (i.e., by using
<CODE>-gui</CODE> to start up CSS), <CODE>edit</CODE> will bring up a graphical edit
dialog for the given object, which must be either a script-defined or
hard-coded <CODE>class</CODE> object.  The optional second argument, if
<CODE>true</CODE>, will cause the system to wait for the user to close the
edit dialog before continuing execution of the script.
<DT><CODE>enums</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
Shows a list of all the current <CODE>enum</CODE> types.  Note that most
<CODE>enum</CODE> types are defined within a <CODE>class</CODE> scope, and can be
found there by using the <CODE>type</CODE> command on the class type.
<DT><CODE>exit</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX226"></A>
Exits from the program (CSS), or from another program space if
<CODE>chsh</CODE> (or its GUI equivalent) was called.
<DT><CODE>frame [&#60;back&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
Shows the variables and their values associated with the current block
or frame of processing.  The optional argument gives the number of
frames back from the current one to display.  This is most relevant for
debugging at a breakpoint, since otherwise there will only be a single,
top-level frame to display.
<DT><CODE>functions</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX228"></A>
Shows a list of all of the currently defined functions.
<DT><CODE>globals</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX229"></A>
Shows a list of all of the currently defined global variables, including
those in the script and hard-coded ones.
<DT><CODE>goto &#60;src_ln&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX230"></A>
Continues execution at the given source line.  
<DT><CODE>help [&#60;expr&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
Shows a short help message, including lists of commands and functions
available.  When passed argument (command, function, class, etc),
provides help information for it.
<DT><CODE>inherit &#60;object_type&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX232"></A>
Shows the inheritance path for the given object type.
<DT><CODE>list [&#60;start_ln&#62; [&#60;n_lns&#62;]] [&#60;function&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX233"></A>
Lists the program source (or machine code, if <CODE>debug</CODE> is 2 or
greater), optionally starting at the given source line number, and
continuing for either 20 lines (the initial default) or the number given
by the second argument (which then becomes the new default).
Alternatively, a function name can be given, which will start the
listing at the beginning of that function (even if the function is
<CODE>extern</CODE>al and does not appear in a line-number based list).
<CODE>list</CODE> with no arguments will resume where the last one left off.
<DT><CODE>load &#60;program_file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
Loads and compiles a new program from the given file.
<DT><CODE>mallinfo</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
Generates a listing of the current <CODE>malloc</CODE> memory allocation
statistics, including changes from the last time the command was called.
<DT><CODE>print &#60;expr&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
Prints the results of the given expression (which can be any valid CSS
expression), giving some type information and following with a new line
(<CODE>\n</CODE>).  This is useful for debugging, but not for printing values
as part of an executing program.
<DT><CODE>printr &#60;object&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX237"></A>
Prints an object and any of its sub-objects in a indented style
output.  This can be very long for objects near the top of the object
hierarchy (i.e., the root object), so be careful!
<DT><CODE>reload</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX238"></A>
Reloads the current program from the last file that was <CODE>load</CODE>ed.
This is useful because you do not have to specify the program file when
making a series of changes to a program.
<DT><CODE>remove &#60;var_name&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
Removes given variable from whatever space it was defined in.  This can
be useful if a variable was defined accidentally or given the wrong name
during interactive use.
<DT><CODE>reset</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
Reset is like <CODE>clearall</CODE>, except that it does not remove any
top-level variables that might have been defined.  Neither of these
commands will remove anything declared <CODE>extern</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>restart</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
Resets the script to start at the beginning.  This is useful if you want
to stop execution of the program after a break point.
<DT><CODE>run</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX242"></A>
Runs the script from the start (as opposed to <CODE>cont</CODE> which
continues execution from the current location).
<DT><CODE>setbp &#60;src_ln&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX243"></A>
Sets a breakpoint at the given source-code line.  Execution of the
program will break when it gets to that line, and you will be able to
examine variables, etc.
<DT><CODE>setout &#60;ostream&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX244"></A>
Sets the default output of CSS commands to the given stream.  This can
be used to redirect listings or program tracing output to a file.
<DT><CODE>settings</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
Shows the current values of various system-level settings or parameters.
These settings are all static members of the class <CODE>ta_Misc</CODE>, and
can be set by using the scoped member name, for example:
<CODE>ta_Misc::display_width = 90;</CODE>
<DT><CODE>shell &#60;"shell_cmd"&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX246"></A>
Executes the given Unix shell command (i.e., <CODE>shell "ls -lt"</CODE>).
<DT><CODE>showbp</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX247"></A>
Shows a list of all currently defined breakpoints, and the source code
line they point to.
<DT><CODE>source &#60;cmd_file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX248"></A>
Loads a file which contains a series of commands or statements, which
are executed exactly as if they were entered from the keyboard.  Note
that this is different than <CODE>load</CODE>ing a program, which merely
compiles the program but does not execute it immediately thereafter.
<CODE>source</CODE> uses run mode, while <CODE>load</CODE> uses define mode.
<DT><CODE>stack</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX249"></A>
Displays the current contents of the stack.  This can be useful for
debugging.
<DT><CODE>status</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX250"></A>
Displays a brief listing of various status parameters, such as current
source line, depth, etc.
<DT><CODE>step &#60;step_n&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX251"></A>
Sets the single-step mode for program execution.  The parameter is the
number of lines to step through before pausing.  A value of 0 turns off
single stepping.
<DT><CODE>tokens &#60;obj_type&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX252"></A>
Lists the instances of the given object type which are known to have
been created.  Many object types do not register tokens, which will be
indicated in the results of this command if applicable.  It is possible
to refer to the objects by their position in this list with the
<CODE>Token</CODE> function, which can be a useful shortcut to using the
object's path.
<DT><CODE>trace [&#60;level&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX253"></A>
Displays a trace of the functions called up to the current one (i.e., as
called from within a breakpoint). A trace level of 0 (the default) just
gives function names, line numbers, and the source code for the
function call, while level 1 adds stack information, level 2 adds
stack and auto variable state information, and level 3 gives a complete
dump of all available information.
<DT><CODE>type &#60;type_name&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX254"></A>
Gives type information about the given type.  This includes full
information about classes (both hard-coded and script-defined),
including members, functions, scoped types (enums), etc.
<DT><CODE>undo</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX255"></A>
This undoes the previous statement, when in <CODE>define</CODE> mode.
<DT><CODE>unsetbp &#60;src_ln&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX256"></A>
Removes a breakpoint associated with the given source-code line number.
