The NetLogView is similar to the TextLogView in that it displays the
log's data in a textual representation. Its main difference however is
that instead of displaying the values in its own window, it displays
its data as labels in an associated network's views. Thus the
NetLogView has one important field, <CODE>network</CODE>, which is the
network to display into.  By default, the <CODE>network</CODE> is set to the
one used by the process that updates the log.  The data is displayed
in each of the network's views by adding labels to the NetViews and
changing the text in those labels. The labels can be repositioned (as
a group or individually) and edited in the NetView to change their
fonts.  The labels are arranged in columns at the upper left of the
netview.

The following functions on the <B>Actions</B> menu are available to
control the display:
