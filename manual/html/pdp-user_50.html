Some objects may have multiple windows. These multiple windows are
called views, and provide alternative methods of interacting with the
same object and its data. <B>In a view window then menubar at the top of
the window is split into a left menubar and a right menubar.</B> The left
menubar contains menus whose actions pertain the the base object of the
view. The right menubar contains menus whose actions pertain to this
particular view only. For instance, a network object may have multiple
netviews. In each netview there will be the left and right menubars
along the top of the window. In the left menubar one would find menus
with function that are particular to the network, such as menus for
adding new layers, or removing all connections. In the right menubar on
would find menus with functions that are particular to the view, such as
setting the colors or shape of the units in the view.

</P>
<P>
Each view has an associated list of Schedule processes
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_150.html">12.2  The Schedule Process (SchedProcess)</A>) which update the view in the course of their
processing. By adding or removing these "updaters", one can control the
grain at which changing data is displayed. For instance, in the netview
the colors of the units change to reflect their current values whenever
the view is updated. If the updater was a trial level process then the
view would display new values for all the units after every trial.
