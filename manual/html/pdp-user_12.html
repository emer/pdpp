It is impossible to anticipate all of the things that a user might want
to do in running and controlling a simulation.  For this reason, we have
built a powerful script language into the PDP++ software.  This script
language, called CSS for C-Super-Script or C^C, is essentially a C/C++
interpreter, and thus does not require the user to learn any new syntax
apart from that which would be required to program additions to the
software itself.  This shared syntax means that code developed initially
in the script language can be compiled into the software later for
faster performance, without requiring significant modifications.

</P>

CSS scripts are used in several places throughout the software.  They
have been added to some of the basic objects to enable their function to
be defined and extended at run time.  Examples of these include a
<B>ScriptEnv</B>, which allows an <B>Environment</B> to be defined dynamically
and have events that are generated on the fly, potentially in response
to the output of the network itself (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_147.html">11.11  Other Environment Types</A>).  The
<B>ScriptPrjnSpec</B> allows arbitrary patterns of connectivity to be
defined (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_124.html">10.3.3.5  Miscellaneous other Projection Types</A>).  The <B>ScriptStat</B> allows arbitrary
statistics to be computed and recorded in the data logs during training
and testing (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_179.html">12.8.8  Miscellaneous Other Stat Types</A>).

</P>
<P>
In addition to these targeted uses, scripts can be used to perform
miscellaneous tasks or repetitive functions at any level of the
software.  It is possible to attach a set of scripts to a given process,
run them automatically when the process starts up, and even record
actions performed in the user interface as script code that can be
replayed later, edited for other uses, etc.  For more information on
these objects, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_110.html">9.6  Project Scripts</A>.

</P>
<P>
Finally, the script language provides a means for interacting with a
simulation when the graphical interface cannot be used, such as over
dial-up lines when working from home, etc.  Anything that can be done in
the GUI can be done in the script language, although it is not quite as
easy.
