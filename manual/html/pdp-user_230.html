<H2><A NAME="IDX1411" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">16.1  Overview of the So Implementation</A></H2>

<P>
The So implementation is designed to be used in a mix-and-match fashion.
Thus, there are a number of different learning algorithms, and several
different activation functions, each of which can be used with the
other.  The learning algorithms are implemented as different connection
specs derived from a basic <B>SoConSpec</B> type.  They all use the same
<B>SoCon</B> connection type object.

</P>
<P>
Unlike the other algorithms in the PDP++ distribution (Bp and Cs), the
So implementation uses <B>LayerSpec</B> objects extensively.  These layer
specifications implement competition among units in the same layer,
which is central to the self-organizing algorithms.  Thus, there are
three different layer specs all derived from a common <B>SoLayerSpec</B>
which implement hard competitive learning (<B>Cl</B>), soft competitive
learning (<B>SoftCl</B>), and the self-organizing map (<B>Som</B>) activation
functions.

</P>
<P>
There are no new statistics defined for self-organizing learning, and
only one process object, which performs a simple feed-forward processing
trial (all of the So algorithms are feed-forward).
