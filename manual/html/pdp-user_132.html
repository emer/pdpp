<B> Figure: </B> The NetView View Region
<P>

<P>
The View Region is the core of the NetView and provides a multitude of
configurable options to the user. The network's layers, units, and
connections can be viewed, manipulated, scaled, and arranged as the user
desires. In addition, arbitrary descriptive labels can be placed in the
View Region to annotate the network. The user has full control over the
colors used to view the network and can print the View Region itself
using the PrintData() command on the NetView. Idraw image files may
also be loaded into the View Region's background.

</P>
<P>
Non-obvious actions you can perform on objects in the NetView:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>Single-click with left-mouse-button (LMB)</B>
<DD>
Will select or deselect item, and update the action buttons at the left
of the display.
<DT><B>Single-click with right-mouse-button (RMB)</B>
<DD>
Will bring up the edit dialog for that object (for Layer names and
labels).
<DT><B>Shift-LMB or middle-mouse-button</B>
<DD>
Extends the selection to include multiple items.
</DL>

<P>
<B>Layers</B> are displayed in the View Region as a rectangular boxes.  The
position of the layers is controlled by their <CODE>pos</CODE> member and the
layer's size is controlled by the layer's <CODE>geom</CODE> member
variable.

</P>
<P>
Within the Layer Box, <B>Units</B> are displayed as smaller
rectangular boxes. The unit's <CODE>pos</CODE> variable controls its relative
offset from the layer's position. If there are <B>Unit_Groups</B> within
the layer, they are represented with their own box which surrounds the
units they contain, and there are also two boxes associated with the
layer in this case.  One box represents the default size of each
subgroup of units in the layer, and is the primary one that is selected
and manipulated in the interface.  An additional box surrounds all of
the unit groups, and identifies the extent of the layer as
whole.

</P>
<P>
<B>Projections</B> are displayed as arrows starting at the sending
layer's Layer Box and pointing at the receiving layer's LayerBox. In
addition units and layers may have text near them which display their
name or current value.

</P>
<P>
The actions of the mouse in the View Region are dependent upon the mode
of the region selected by the Mode Buttons in the Action Region of the
NetView.

</P>
<P>
In <B>Select Mode</B> the pointer is a small arrow. Clicking the left or
right mouse button on an object selects the object under the pointer and
unselects all other object. Clicking the middle mouse button selects
also selects the object, but does not unselect the other selected
objects. When an object is selected its border is drawn with a dashed
line. Re-Selecting an already selected object Un-Selects the object.
When a <B>Layer</B> or <B>Unit_Group</B> is selected, it will be displayed as
grid instead of an outlined box. The grid provides the user with a
depiction of how many units the layer or group contains, as well as the
size and spacing of the units.

</P>
<P>
The names of the <B>Minor Action Buttons</B> in the Action Region will
change is accordance with the objects which are selected. Since layers,
unit groups, and units overlap, a special selection method is
implemented for deciding which object is selected. On the first click of
the mouse button, the layer is selected. On the second click, the layer
is unselected and the unit group is selected. On the third click, an
individual unit is selected. On the fourth click the individual unit is
unselected.

</P>
<P>
In <B>View Mode</B> the pointer becomes a small pointing hand. This mode is
used for selecting units from which to view sending or receiving weight
values. View mode is orthogonal to select mode and is illustrated by a
dotted line surrounding an object. Thus objects can be both selected
and/or viewed at the same time. Since it is only useful to View
individual units, clicking on a layer bypasses the Layer and Unit_Group
selection of Select Mode and directly hi-lights a unit for viewing.
Indeed, only units can be viewed.  Clicking with the middle mouse button
invokes the split unit mode and shows the sending or receiving values
for multiple units.

</P>
<P>
In the other four modes, selection of objects occurs as in select mode.
Each level of selection occurs on the up release of the mouse button,
and these modes always operate on the currently selected object if there
is one.

</P>
<P>
Therefore, to <I>Move</I> a layer, simply click on the layer and hold down
the mouse button and move the layer.

</P>
<P>
To move a unit group, click on the layer and release, so that the unit
group is selected.  Then, the next down press will grab the unit group
for moving -- press and hold and move.

</P>
<P>
To move a unit, click twice, once to get through the layer, again to get
through the unit group, at which point the unit will be selected and
grabbed for moving upon the next down click.

</P>
<P>
In each of the following action modes, when the action is finished, the
selected object is unselected. If no action was taken (i.e., the mouse
button was clicked, but the mouse was not moved) the object remains
selected. In this way, the user can select objects for editing and other
Actions without being forced to re-choose the Select Mode button. In
addition the View Region itself my be manipulated by clicking the mouse
in the background of the View Region and not selecting any objects.

</P>
<P>
In <B>Move Mode</B> layers, unit groups, and units are repositioned on a
coordinate grid with spacing set at the size of an individual unit. As
the layer or unit object is moved, the object will jump to the fixed
grid position instead of moving smoothly with the mouse. As a layer or
unit is moved, its position will be displayed in the Coordinate Box at
the top of the Actions Region of the NetView. Using the left or middle
mouse button moves the layer or unit objects in their x-y plane. Using
the right mouse button allows movement in the x-z planes.

</P>
<P>
The head and tail of a projection arrow can be repositioned in Move mode
as well. Although the position of a projection's head or tail is not
constrained to the same grid like movement of the layer and units, it is
constrained to lie within the layer it is connected to.  Layer names and
the arbitrary network labels may be moved without constraint.  Moving
the View Region itself is accomplished by clicking in the background
area of the view. The pointer will change to a flat hand and the View
Region will "slide" as the user moves the mouse. Pressing the middle
mouse button constrains the movement to be horizontal, while pressing
the right mouse button constrains the movement to be vertical.

</P>
<P>
<B>Reshape Mode</B> is used exclusively for changing the geometry of a
layer or unit group.  By clicking and dragging on a layer or unit group,
the geometry (and number of units if there are no actual units created
yet) of the displayed grid changes as the mouse moves. The geometry of
the layer or unit group is displayed in the Coordinate Box at the top of
the Action Region.  If a layer or group already contains units, its area
is constrained to be equal to or greater than the number of unit's in
the layer or group. Thus a layer with 100 units could be sized to be
10x10 or 20x5, but not 4x3.  Further reshaping a layer or group with
units already in it will not change the number of units in the layer,
while this will occur if there are no actual units.

</P>
<P>
<B>Zoom Mode</B> is used to change the magnification (zooming) of objects
in the View Region, or the overall view itself. It is primarily used
to rescale layers for maximum visibility when you have a really big
network.  You can reset the zooming of a layer with
<I>Actions/ResetLayerZoom</I>, or impose a specific amount of zooming
with <I>Actions/ZoomLayer</I>.  If the mouse is pressed in the background
of the View Region, the entire View Region can be scaled. Dragging the
mouse upward zooms in on the region at which the mouse was first
pressed. Dragging downward likewise zooms outward. If the middle mouse
button is pressed only the horizontal dimension is scaled. If the
right mouse button is pressed only the vertical dimension is
scaled. The Init Button in the Action Region can be used to undo
background scaling and recenter the Network, and
<I>Actions/FreezeNetZoom</I> will lock in the current overall view
zooming until a subsequent <I>Actions/AutoNetZoom</I>.

</P>
<P>
The Rotate mode is somewhat frivolous but can be used to further
customize the objects in the View Region, or to manipulate imported
Idraw graphics.
