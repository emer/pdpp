<H3><A NAME="IDX190" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">7.2.3  Accessing Hard-Coded Objects in CSS</A></H3>

<P>
In general, hard-coded objects (and their members and member functions)
are treated just as they would be in C or C++.  Objects that have been
created (i.e., Networks, Units, etc) can be referred to by their
<EM>path</EM> names, which start with the <EM>root</EM> object (PDPRoot).
While you could type <CODE>root.projects[0]</CODE>, for example, to refer to
the first project, it is easier to use the abbreviation of a preceding
period to stand for <CODE>root</CODE>, resulting in: <CODE>.projects[0]</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The following examples were performed on the XOR example project in
Bp++. In order to examine the project in CSS, one could simply use the
<CODE>print</CODE> command on the path of this object:

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; print .projects[0]
.projects[0] Proj (refn=1) {
  ta_Base*        owner           = .projects;
  String          name            = Proj;
  WinBase*        win_owner       = root;
  WinGeometry     win_pos         = {lft=4: bot=74: wd=535: ht=24: };
  WinGeometry     root_win_pos    = {lft=9: bot=79: wd=161: ht=23: };
  TypeDefault_MGroup   defaults           =  Size: 5 (TypeDefault);
  BaseSpec_MGroup   specs         =  Size: 3 (BaseSpec);
  Network_MGroup   networks       =  Size: 1 (Network);
  Environment_MGroup   environments       =  Size: 1 (Environment);
  Process_MGroup   processes      =  Size: 5 (SchedProcess);
  PDPLog_MGroup   logs            =  Size: 2 (TextLog);
  Script_MGroup   scripts         =  Size: 1 (Script);
}
</PRE>

<P>
The first network within this project would then be referred to as
<CODE>.projects[0].networks[0]</CODE>:

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; print .projects[0].networks[0]
.projects[0].networks[0] XOR (refn=15) {
  ta_Base*        owner           = .projects[0].networks;
  String          name            = XOR;
  WinBase*        win_owner       = .projects[0];
  WinGeometry     win_pos         = {lft=4: bot=3: wd=536: ht=390: };
  WinView_MGroup   views          =  Size: 1 (NetView);
  Layer_MGroup    layers          =  Size: 3 (Layer);
  Project*        proj            = .projects[0];
  TDGeometry      pos             = {x=0: y=0: z=0: };
  TDGeometry      max_size        = {x=2: y=2: z=3: };
  int             epoch           = 0;
  Network::Layer_Layout   lay_layout      = THREE_D;
}
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use a shortcut by just typing <CODE>.networks[0]</CODE>, which
finds the first member with the name <CODE>networks</CODE> in a search
starting at the root object and scanning down the <EM>first branch</EM> of
the tree of objects (i.e., looking in the first element of every group
along the way).

</P>
<P>
Scoped types such as <CODE>Network::Layer_Layout</CODE> which appear in the
above class are referred to just as they would be in C++:

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; .networks[0].lay_layout = Network::TWO_D;
</PRE>

<P>
As you can see, setting the values of hard-coded object variables simply
amounts to typing in the appropriate C/C++ statement.

</P>
<P>
Type information (obtained via the TypeAccess system) about hard-coded
objects can be obtained with the <CODE>type</CODE> command:

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; type Network
class Network : PDPWinMgr : WinMgr : WinBase : ta_NBase : ta_Base {
// The Network 

  // sub-types
  enum Layer_Layout {   // Visual mode of layer position/view
    TWO_D            = 0;       // all z = 0, no skew
    THREE_D          = 1;       // z = layer index, default skew
  }

  // members
  ta_Base*        owner;          //   pointer to owner
  String          name;           //   name of the object
  .
  .
  TDGeometry      max_size;       //   max size in each dim
  int             epoch;          //   epoch counter
  Network::Layer_Layout   lay_layout;     // Visual mode of layer 

  // functions
  void            UnSafeCopy(ta_Base* na);
  ta_Base*        GetOwner(TypeDef* tp);
  .
  .
  .
  void            InitWtState();        // Initialize the weights
  .
  .
  void            Compute_dWt();        // update weights for whole net
  void            Copy_Weights(const Network* src);  
  void            Enforce_Layout(Network::Layer_Layout layout_type);
}
</PRE>

<P>
This shows the inheritance of this object, any sub-types that are
defined within it, and all of its members and functions (including those
it inherits from other classes).

</P>
<P>
In addition, there is Tab-completion for path names and types in the CSS
prompt-level script interface.  Thus, as you are typing a path, if you
hit the Tab key, it will try to complete the path.  If there are
multiple completions, hitting Tab twice will display them.

</P>
<P>
In order to call member functions of hard-coded classes, simply give the
path to the object, followed by the member function, with any arguments
that it might require (or none).

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; .networks[0].InitWtState();
bp++&#62; 
</PRE>

<P>
It is possible to create pointers to hard-coded objects.  Simply declare
a pointer variable with the appropriate type, and assign it to the given
object by referring to its path:

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; Unit* un;
bp++&#62; un = .networks[0].layers[1].units[0];
bp++&#62; print un
.projects[0].networks[0].layers[1].units[0] hid_1 (refn=6) {
  ta_Base*        owner           = .projects[0].networks[0].layers[1].units;
  String          name            = hid_1;
  UnitSpec_SPtr   spec            = {type=BpUnitSpec: spec=.specs[0]: };
  TDGeometry      pos             = {x=0: y=0: z=0: };
  Unit::ExtType   ext_flag        = NO_EXTERNAL;
  float           targ            = 0;
  float           ext             = 0;
  float           act             = 0;
  float           net             = 0;
  Con_Group       recv            =  Size: 0.1.2 (BpCon);
  Con_Group       send            =  Size: 0.1.1 (BpCon);
  BpCon           bias            = BpCon;
  float           err             = 0;
  float           dEdA            = 0;
  float           dEdNet          = 0;
}
</PRE>

<P>
There are two ways to create new hard-coded objects.  The preferred way
is to call one of the <CODE>New</CODE> functions on the group-like objects
(<CODE>List</CODE> or <CODE>Group</CODE>, see section <A HREF="pdp-user_91.html">8.2  Groups</A>), which will create
the object and add it to the group, so that it can be referred to by its
path as just described.

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; .layers[1].units.List();

Elements of List:  (2)
hid_1   hid_2 
bp++&#62; .layers[1].units.New(1);
bp++&#62; .layers[1].units.List();

Elements of List:  (3)
hid_1   hid_2    
bp++&#62; .layers[1].units[2].name = "new_guy";
bp++&#62; .layers[1].units.List();

Elements of List:  (3)
hid_1   hid_2   new_guy 
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, it is possible to create new instances of hard-coded object
types through the C++ <CODE>new</CODE> operator, which is especially useful in
order to take advantage of some of the handy built-in types like arrays
(see section <A HREF="pdp-user_96.html">8.3  Arrays</A>):

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; float_RArray* ar = new float_RArray;
bp++&#62; print ar
[0];

bp++&#62; ar.Add(.25);
bp++&#62; ar.Add(.55);
bp++&#62; ar.Add(.11);
bp++&#62; print ar
[3] 0.25 0.55 0.11;

bp++&#62; print ar.Mean();
(Real)  = 0.303333
bp++&#62; print ar.Var();
(Real)  = 0.101067
bp++&#62; ar.Sort();
bp++&#62; print ar
[3] 0.11 0.25 0.55;
</PRE>

<P>
Remember to <CODE>delete</CODE> those objects which you have created in this
fashion:

</P>
<PRE>bp++&#62; delete ar;
bp++&#62; print ar
(float_RArray) ar = 0
</PRE>

<P>
(the <CODE>ar = 0</CODE> means that it is a null pointer).  Be sure <EM>not</EM>
to use the <CODE>delete</CODE> operator on those objects which were created
with the group's <CODE>New</CODE> function, which should be <CODE>Remove</CODE>d
from the group, not deleted directly (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_91.html">8.2  Groups</A>).
