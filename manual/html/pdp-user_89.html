In PDP++, many objects have a <CODE>name</CODE> field.  This gives the
particular object an identifier that can be used to refer to it in the
CSS script language (see section <A HREF="pdp-user_69.html">7.2.3  Accessing Hard-Coded Objects in CSS</A>), and it makes it easier to
identify when you need to point to it one of the GUI operations.

</P>
<P>
All objects when created are given default names that consist of the
their type followed by a number which increases for each subsequent
object of that type which is created.  Thus, the first <B>Layer</B> created
will be called "Layer_0", and so on.

</P>
<P>
Note that the name given to an object is not necessarily the same name
that object will have when saved to a file.  It is simply a value of a
particular member of the object.
