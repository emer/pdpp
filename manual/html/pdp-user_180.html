<H2><A NAME="IDX1084" HREF="pdp-user_toc.html">12.9  Processes and CSS Scripts</A></H2>

<P>
Any kind of process can be configured to use a CSS script instead of its
original hard-coded functions.  One simply sets the process type to
<CODE>SCRIPT</CODE> and opens a script file in the <CODE>script_file</CODE> member
of the process.

</P>
<P>
When the process is run, it checks to see if it should run the script
instead.  Note that if you are replacing a schedule process with a
script, you have to replace the entire C_Code function.  This code can
be used verbatim in CSS, and an example is given in
<TT>`css/include/script_proc.css'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the script is given transparent access to all of the members
and member functions defined on the script object it is attached to.
This allows one to mix existing hard-coded functions with script
versions by simply calling the existing ones in some places, and calling
new script-defined ones in other places.

</P>
<P>
Where possible, it is generally preferable to use a <B>ScriptStat</B> or
<B>ScriptProcess</B> instead of replacing an entire existing process with a
script.  This will tend to be simpler and a more modular solution.
