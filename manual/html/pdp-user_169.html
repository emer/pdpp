Often, one wants to stop training a network once it has reached some
criterion of performance.  This can be done by setting the criterion
values associated with a statistic value.  All statistic values are
represented by a <B>StatVal</B> object, which has fields for representing
the stopping criterion.  The criterion is represented with a relational
operator (less than, equal to, etc.) and a comparison value.  The fields
are as follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>float value</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1029"></A>
This holds the current computed or aggregated value of the statistic.
<DT><CODE>bool flag</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1030"></A>
This flag indicates if a stopping criterion is active for this
statistic.  If it is not checked, the remaining fields are ignored.
<DT><CODE>Relation rel</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1031"></A>
This is the relational operator to compare <CODE>value</CODE> and <CODE>val</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>float val</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1032"></A>
This is the comparison value to compare <CODE>value</CODE> with.
<DT><CODE>int cnt</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1033"></A>
This indicates how many times the relation must be met in order to pass
criterion.  This can be useful to make sure a network has reliable
performance under criterion by requiring it to pass muster 2 or 3 times
in a row, for example.
