todo list for ta:

- possibility of splitting _TA.cc[x] file into several parts, as given
	by a parameter to maketa.  this would help the hp, and make
	compilation go a bit faster..

- fix css calling so that all member funs don't need to be recreated for
	multiple inheritance (i.e., casting of the base should use
	smart parent_off type things)
 
- tolerate initializer exprs in constructors

- sub-classes don't get members/methods..
	- need to make a concatenated name or something like that

- variable (not just default) args are not flagged appropriately

- ta_ListItr types are not being assigned values in the non-const ref arg
	for FirstEl, NextEl, etc.
	- need to understand ta_ListItr as a castable type
	- (can't all class simply be copied with an equals sign?
	   and we could have a comment directive for non-copieable types).
